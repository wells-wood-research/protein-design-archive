        "Abstract":"X-ray diffraction shows the structure of a synthetic protein model, formed from noncovalent self-association of a 12-residue peptide and of sulfate ions at low pH. This peptide is a fragment of a 16-residue polypeptide that was designed to form an amphiphilic alpha helix with a ridge of Leu residues along one helical face. By interdigitation of the leucines of four such helices, the design called for self-association into a four-alpha-helical bundle. The crystal structure (2.7 angstrom resolution; R factor = 0.215) reveals a structure more complex than the design, with both a tetramer and a hexamer. The alpha-helical tetramer with leucine interior has more oblique crossing angles than most four-alpha-helical bundles; the hexamer has a globular hydrophobic core of 12 leucine residues and three associated sulfate ions. Computational analysis suggests that the hexameric association is tighter than the tetrameric one. The consistency of the structure with the design is discussed, as well as the divergence."

        "Abstract":"Electrostatic interactions are often critical for determining the specificity of protein-protein complexes. To study the role of electrostatic interactions for assembly of helical bundles, we previously designed a thermostable, heterotrimeric coiled coil, ABC, in which charged residues were employed to drive preferential association of three distinct, 34-residue helices. To investigate the basis for heterotrimer specificity, we have used multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) analysis to determine the 1.8 A resolution crystal structure of ABC. The structure shows that ABC forms a heterotrimeric coiled coil with the intended arrangement of parallel chains. Over half of the ion pairs engineered to restrict helix associations were apparent in the experimental electron density map. As seen in other trimeric coiled coils, ABC displays acute knobs-into-holes packing and a buried anion coordinated by core polar amino acids. These interactions validate the design strategy and illustrate how packing and polar contacts determine structural uniqueness."

        "Abstract":"A 12-residue peptide designed to form an alpha-helix and self-associate into an antiparallel 4-alpha-helical bundle yields a 0.9 A crystal structure revealing unanticipated features. The structure was determined by direct phasing with the \"Shake-and-Bake\" program, and contains four crystallographically distinct 12-mer peptide molecules plus solvent for a total of 479 atoms. The crystal is formed from nearly ideal alpha-helices hydrogen bonded head-to-tail into columns, which in turn pack side-by-side into sheets spanning the width of the crystal. Within each sheet, the alpha-helices run antiparallel and are closely spaced (9-10 A center-to-center). The sheets are more loosely packed against each other (13-14 A between helix centers). Each sheet is amphiphilic: apolar leucine side chains project from one face, charged lysine and glutamate side chains from the other face. The sheets are stacked with two polar faces opposing and two apolar faces opposing. The result is a periodic biomaterial composed of packed protein bilayers, with alternating polar and apolar interfaces. All of the 30 water molecules in the unit cell lie in the polar interface or between the stacked termini of helices. A section through the sheet reveals that the helices packed at the apolar interface resemble the four-alpha-helical bundle of the design, but the helices overhang parts of the adjacent bundles, and the helix crossing angles are less steep than intended (7-11 degrees rather than 18 degrees)."

Unlike the designed parallel coiled coil, the helices run up-up-down. The structure is stabilized by a distinctive hydrophobic interface consisting of eight layers. As in the design, each alpha-helix in the coiled coil contributes one leucine side chain to each layer. The structure suggests that hydrophobic interactions are a dominant factor in the stabilization of coiled coils. The stoichiometry and geometry of coiled coils are primarily determined by side chain packing in the solvent-inaccessible interior, but electrostatic interactions also contribute."

        "Abstract":"Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) has consistently been shown to induce secondary structure, particularly alpha-helices, in polypeptides, and is commonly used to model membrane and other hydrophobic environments. However, the precise mechanism by which SDS induces these conformational changes remains unclear. To examine the role of electrostatic interactions in this mechanism, we have designed two hydrophilic, charged amphipathic alpha-helical peptides, one basic (QAPAYKKAAKKLAES) and the other acidic (QAPAYEEAAEELAKS), and their structures were studied by CD and NMR. The design of the peptides is based on the sequence of the segment of residues 56-70 of human platelet factor 4 [PF4(56-70), QAPLYKKIIKKLLES]. Both peptides were unstructured in water, and in the presence of neutral, zwitterionic, or cationic detergents. However, in SDS at neutral pH, the basic peptide folded into an alpha-helix. By contrast, the pH needed to be lowered to 1.8 before alpha-helix formation was observed for the acidic peptide. Strong, attractive electrostatic interactions, between the anionic groups of SDS and the cationic groups of the lysines, appeared to be necessary to initiate the folding of the basic peptide. NMR analysis showed that the basic peptide was fully embedded in SDS-peptide micelles, and that its three-dimensional alpha-helical structure could be superimposed on that of the native structure of PF4(56-70). These results enabled us to propose a working model of the basic peptide-SDS complex, and a mechanism for SDS-induced alpha-helical folding. This study demonstrates that, while the folding of peptides is mostly driven by hydrophobic effects, electrostatic interactions play a significant role in the formation and the stabilization of SDS-induced structure."

        "Abstract":"De novo protein design provides an attractive approach for the construction of models to probe the features required for function of complex metalloproteins. The metal-binding sites of many metalloproteins lie between multiple elements of secondary structure, inviting a retrostructural approach to constructing minimal models of their active sites. The backbone geometries comprising the metal-binding sites of zinc fingers, diiron proteins, and rubredoxins may be described to within approximately 1 A rms deviation by using a simple geometric model with only six adjustable parameters. These geometric models provide excellent starting points for the design of metalloproteins, as illustrated in the construction of Due Ferro 1 (DF1), a minimal model for the Glu-Xxx-Xxx-His class of dinuclear metalloproteins. This protein was synthesized and structurally characterized as the di-Zn(II) complex by x-ray crystallography, by using data that extend to 2.5 A. This four-helix bundle protein is comprised of two noncovalently associated helix-loop-helix motifs. The dinuclear center is formed by two bridging Glu and two chelating Glu side chains, as well as two monodentate His ligands. The primary ligands are mostly buried in the protein interior, and their geometries are stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds to second-shell ligands. In particular, a Tyr residue forms a hydrogen bond to a chelating Glu ligand, similar to a motif found in the diiron-containing R2 subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase and the ferritins. DF1 also binds cobalt and iron ions and should provide an attractive model for a variety of diiron proteins that use oxygen for processes including iron storage, radical formation, and hydrocarbon oxidation."

        "Abstract":"The computational redesign of the second zinc finger of Zif268 to produce a 28 residue peptide (FSD-1) that assumes a betabetaalpha fold without metal binding was recently reported. In order to explore the tolerance of this metal-free fold towards sequence variability, six additional peptides resulting from the ORBIT computational protein design process were synthesized and characterized. The experimental stabilities of five of these peptides are strongly correlated with the energies calculated by ORBIT. However, when a peptide with a mutation in the beta-turn is examined, the calculated stability does not accurately predict the experimentally determined stability. The NMR solution structure of a peptide incorporating this mutation (FSD-EY) reveals that the register between the beta-strands is different from the model structure used to select and score the sequences. FSD-EY has a type I' turn instead of the target EbaaagbE turn (rubredoxin knuckle). Two additional peptides that have improved side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonding and turn propensity for the target turn were characterized. Both are of stability comparable to that of FSD-1. These results demonstrate the robustness of the ORBIT protein design methods and underscore the need for continued improvements in negative design."

        "Abstract":"Residues of opposite charge often populate heptad positions g (heptad i on chain 1) and e' (heptad i + 1 on chain 2) in dimeric coiled coils and may stabilize the dimer by formation of interchain ion pairs. To investigate the contribution to stability of such electrostatic interactions we have designed a disulfide-linked heterodimeric zipper (AB zipper) consisting of the acidic chain Ac-E-VAQLEKE-VAQAEAE-NYQLEQE-VAQLEHE-CG-NH(2) and the basic chain Ac-E-VQALKKR-VQALKAR-NYAAKQK-VQALRHK-CG-NH(2) in which all e and g positions are occupied by either E or K\/R to form a maximum of seven interhelical salt bridges. Temperature-induced denaturation experiments monitored by circular dichroism reveal a stable coiled coil conformation below 50 degrees C and in the pH range 1.2-8.0. Stability is highest at pH approximately 4.0 [DeltaG(U) (37 degrees C) = 5.18 +\/- 0.51 kcal mol(-)(1)]. The solution structure of the AB zipper at pH 5.65 has been elucidated on the basis of homonuclear (1)H NMR data collected at 800 MHz [heavy atom rmsd's for the ensemble of 50 calculated structures are 0.47 +\/- 0.13 A (backbone) and 0.95 +\/- 0.16 A (all)]. Both chains of the AB zipper are almost entirely in alpha-helical conformation and form a superhelix with a left-handed twist. Overhauser connectivities reveal close contacts between g position residues (heptad i on chain 1) and residues d\/f (heptad i on chain 1), residues a\/d (heptad i + 1 on chain 1), and residue a' (heptad i + 1 on chain 2). Residues in position e (heptad i on chain 1) are in contact with residues a\/b\/d\/f (heptad i on chain 1) and residue d' (heptad i on chain 2). These connectivities hint at a relatively defined alignment of the side chains across the helix interface. Partial H-bond formation between the functional groups of residues g and e'(+1) is observed in the calculated structures. NMR pH titration experiments disclose pK(a) values for Glu delta-carboxylate groups: 4.14 +\/- 0.02 (E(1)), 4.82 +\/- 0.07 (E(6)), 4.52 +\/- 0.01 (E(8)), 4.37 +\/- 0.03 (E(13)), 4.11 +\/- 0.02 (E(15)), 4.41 +\/- 0.07 (E(20)), 4.82 +\/- 0.03 (E(22)), 4.65 +\/- 0.04 (E(27)), 4.63 +\/- 0.03 (E(29)), 4.22 +\/- 0.02 (E(1)(')). By comparison with pK(a) of Glu in unfolded peptides ( approximately 4. 3 +\/- 0.1), our pK(a) data suggest marginal or even unfavorable contribution of charged Glu to the stability of the AB zipper. The electrostatic energy gained from interhelical ion pairs is likely to be surpassed by hydrophobic energy terms upon protonation of Glu, due to increased hydrophobicity of uncharged Glu and, thus, better packing against apolar residues at the chain interface."

        "Abstract":"Three-dimensional (3D) domain-swapped proteins are intermolecularly folded analogs of monomeric proteins; both are stabilized by the identical interactions, but the individual domains interact intramolecularly in monomeric proteins, whereas they form intermolecular interactions in 3D domain-swapped structures. The structures and conditions of formation of several domain-swapped dimers and trimers are known, but the formation of higher order 3D domain-swapped oligomers has been less thoroughly studied. Here we contrast the structural consequences of domain swapping from two designed three-helix bundles: one with an up-down-up topology, and the other with an up-down-down topology. The up-down-up topology gives rise to a domain-swapped dimer whose structure has been determined to 1.5 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. In contrast, the domain-swapped protein with an up-down-down topology forms fibrils as shown by electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. This demonstrates that design principles can predict the oligomeric state of 3D domain-swapped molecules, which should aid in the design of domain-swapped proteins and biomaterials."

        "Abstract":"Small proteins or protein domains generally require disulfide bridges or metal sites for their stabilization. Here it is shown that the beta beta alpha architecture of zinc fingers can be reproduced in a 23-residue polypeptide in the absence of metal ions. The sequence was obtained through an iterative design process. A key feature of the final design is the incorporation of a type II' beta turn to aid in beta-hairpin formation. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis reveals that the alpha helix and beta hairpin are held together by a defined hydrophobic core. The availability of this structural template has implications for the development of functional polypeptides."

        "Abstract":"Because of the simplicity and regularity of the alpha-helical coiled coil relative to other structural motifs, it can be conveniently used to clarify the molecular interactions responsible for protein folding and stability. Here we describe the de novo design and characterization of a two heptad-repeat peptide stabilized by a complex network of inter- and intrahelical salt bridges. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation show that this peptide is highly alpha-helical and 100% dimeric tinder physiological buffer conditions. Interestingly, the peptide was shown to switch its oligomerization state from a dimer to a trimer upon increasing ionic strength. The correctness of the rational design principles used here is supported by details of the atomic structure of the peptide deduced from X-ray crystallography. The structure of the peptide shows that it is not a molten globule but assumes a unique, native-like conformation. This de novo peptide thus represents an attractive model system for the design of a molecular recognition system."

        "Abstract":"Here we present a combinatorial approach to evolve a stable beta-hairpin fold in a linear peptide. Starting with a de novo-designed linear peptide that shows a beta-hairpin structure population of around 30%, we selected four positions to build up a combinatorial library of 20(4) sequences. Deconvolution of the library using circular dichroism reduced such a sequence complexity to 36 defined sequences. Circular dichroism and NMR of these peptides resulted in the identification of two linear 14-aa-long peptides that in plain buffered solutions showed a percentage of beta-hairpin structure higher than 70%. Our results show how combinatorial approaches can be used to obtain highly structured peptide sequences that could be used as templates in which functionality can be introduced."

        "Abstract":"De novo design of proteins provides an attractive approach to uncover the essential features required for their functions. Previously, we described the design and crystal structure determination of a di-Zn(II) complex of \"due-ferri-1\" (DF1), a protein patterned after the diiron-dimanganese class of redox-active proteins [Lombardi, A.; Summa, C.; Geremia, S.; Randaccio, L.; Pavone, V.; DeGrado, W. F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000, 97, 6298-6305]. The overall structure of DF1, which contains a carboxylate-bridged dinuclear metal site, agrees well with the intended design. However, access to this dimetal site is blocked by a pair of hydrophobic leucine residues (L13 and L13'), which prevent facile entry of metal ions and small molecules. We have now taken the next step in the eventual construction of a catalytically active metalloenzyme by engineering an active site cavity into DF1 through the replacement of these two leucine residues with smaller residues. The crystal structure of the dimanganous form of L13A-DF1 indeed shows a substrate access channel to the dimetal center. In the crystal structure, water molecules and a ligating dimethyl sulfoxide molecule, which forms a monatomic bridge between the metal ions, occupy the cavity. Furthermore, the diferric form of a derivative of L13A-DF1, DF2, is shown to bind azide, acetate, and small aromatic molecules."

        "Abstract":"Designed peptides that fold autonomously to specific conformations in aqueous solution are useful for elucidating protein secondary structural preferences. For example, autonomously folding model systems have been essential for establishing the relationship between alpha-helix length and alpha-helix stability, which would be impossible to probe with alpha-helices embedded in folded proteins. Here, we use designed peptides to examine the effect of strand length on antiparallel beta-sheet stability. alpha-Helices become more stable as they grow longer. Our data show that a two-stranded beta-sheet (\"beta-hairpin\") becomes more stable when the strands are lengthened from five to seven residues, but that further strand lengthening to nine residues does not lead to further beta-hairpin stabilization for several extension sequences examined. (In one case, all-threonine extension, there may be an additional stabilization on strand lengthening from seven to nine residues.) These results suggest that there may be an intrinsic limit to strand length for most sequences in antiparallel beta-sheet secondary structure."

At low temperature and pH 3, homo- and heteronuclear NMR data report a dominant folded ('f') conformation with well-dispersed chemical shifts, i, i+1 periodicity, numerous long-range NOEs, and slowed amide hydrogen isotope exchange patterns that is a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with nonsymmetrical and specific association of CM I and CM II. BetaCore 'f' conformations undergo reversible, global, moderately cooperative, non-two-state thermal transitions to an equilibrium ensemble of unfolded 'u' conformations. There is a significant energy barrier between 'f' and 'u' conformations. This is the first designed four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet that folds in water."

        "Abstract":"Here we present a combinatorial approach to evolve a stable beta-hairpin fold in a linear peptide. Starting with a de novo-designed linear peptide that shows a beta-hairpin structure population of around 30%, we selected four positions to build up a combinatorial library of 20(4) sequences. Deconvolution of the library using circular dichroism reduced such a sequence complexity to 36 defined sequences. Circular dichroism and NMR of these peptides resulted in the identification of two linear 14-aa-long peptides that in plain buffered solutions showed a percentage of beta-hairpin structure higher than 70%. Our results show how combinatorial approaches can be used to obtain highly structured peptide sequences that could be used as templates in which functionality can be introduced."

        "Abstract":"An important goal in biology is to predict from sequence data the high-resolution structures of proteins and the interactions that occur between them. In this paper, we describe a computational approach that can make these types of predictions for a series of coiled-coil dimers. Our method comprises a dual strategy that augments extensive conformational sampling with molecular mechanics minimization. To test the performance of the method, we designed six heterodimeric coiled coils with a range of stabilities and solved x-ray crystal structures for three of them. The stabilities and structures predicted by the calculations agree very well with experimental data: the average error in unfolding free energies is <1 kcal\/mol, and nonhydrogen atoms in the predicted structures superimpose onto the experimental structures with rms deviations <0.7 A. We have also tested the method on a series of homodimers derived from vitellogenin-binding protein. The predicted relative stabilities of the homodimers show excellent agreement with previously published experimental measurements. A critical step in our procedure is to use energy minimization to relax side-chain geometries initially selected from a rotamer library. Our results show that computational methods can predict interaction specificities that are in good agreement with experimental data."

        "Abstract":"Alpha-helical coiled coils are a common protein oligomerization motif stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions occurring along the coiled-coil interface. We have recently designed and solved the structure of a two-heptad repeat coiled-coil peptide that is stabilized further by a complex network of inter- and intrahelical salt-bridges in addition to the hydrophobic interactions. Here, we extend and improve the de novo design of this two heptad-repeat peptide by four newly designed peptides characterized by different types of ionic interactions. The contribution of these different types of ionic interactions to coiled-coil stability are analyzed by CD spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation. We show that all peptides are highly alpha-helical and two of them are 100% dimeric under physiological conditions. Furthermore, we have solved the X-ray structure of the most stable of these peptides and the rational design principles are verified by comparing this structure to the structure of the parent peptide. We show that by combining the most favorable inter- and intrahelical salt-bridge arrangements it is possible to design coiled-coil oligomerization domains with improved stability properties."

These constructs optimize a novel fold, designated as the 'Trp-cage' motif, and are significantly more stable than any other miniprotein reported to date. Folding is cooperative and hydrophobically driven by the encapsulation of a Trp side chain in a sheath of Pro rings. As the smallest protein-like construct, Trp-cage miniproteins should provide a testing ground for both experimental studies and computational simulations of protein folding and unfolding pathways. Pro Trp interactions may be a particularly effective strategy for the a priori design of self-folding peptides."

We have recently de novo designed and optimized a series of two-heptad repeat long coiled-coil peptides which are further stabilized by a complex network of inter- and intrahelical salt bridges. Here we have extended the de novo design of such two heptad-repeat long peptides by removing the central and most important g-e' Arg to Glu (g-e'RE) ionic interhelical interaction and replacing these residues by alanine residues. The effect of the missing interhelical ionic interaction on coiled-coil formation and stability has been analyzed by CD spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and X-ray crystallography. We show that the peptide, while being highly alpha-helical, is no longer able to form a parallel coiled-coil structure but rather assumes an octameric globular helical assembly devoid of any coiled-coil interactions."

        "Abstract":"A structural motif, the tryptophan zipper (trpzip), greatly stabilizes the beta-hairpin conformation in short peptides. Peptides (12 or 16 aa in length) with four different turn sequences are monomeric and fold cooperatively in water, as has been observed previously for some hairpin peptides. However, the folding free energies of the trpzips exceed substantially those of all previously reported beta-hairpins and even those of some larger designed proteins. NMR structures of three of the trpzip peptides reveal exceptionally well-defined beta-hairpin conformations stabilized by cross-strand pairs of indole rings. The trpzips are the smallest peptides to adopt an unique tertiary fold without requiring metal binding, unusual amino acids, or disulfide crosslinks."

        "Abstract":"The use of side chains as catalytic cofactors for protein mediated redox chemistry raises significant mechanistic issues as to how these amino acids are activated toward radical chemistry in a controlled manner. De novo protein design has been used to examine the structural basis for the creation and maintenance of a tryptophanyl radical in a three-helix bundle protein maquette. Here we report the detailed structural analysis of the protein by multidimensional NMR methods. An interesting feature of the structure is an apparent pi-cation interaction involving the sole tryptophan and a lysine side chain. Hybrid density functional calculations support the notion that this interaction raises the reduction potential of the W degrees \/WH redox pair and helps explain the redox characteristics of the protein. This model protein system therefore provides a powerful model for exploring the structural basis for controlled radical chemistry in protein."

        "Abstract":"Maquettes are de novo designed mimicries of nature used to test the construction and engineering criteria of oxidoreductases. One type of scaffold used in maquette construction is a four-alpha-helical bundle. The sequence of the four-alpha-helix bundle maquettes follows a heptad repeat pattern typical of left-handed coiled-coils. Initial designs were molten globular due partly to the minimalist approach taken by the designers. Subsequent iterative redesign generated several structured scaffolds with similar heme binding properties. Variant [I(6)F(13)](2), a structured scaffold, was partially resolved with NMR spectroscopy and found to have a set of mobile inter-helical packing interfaces. Here, the X-ray structure of a similar peptide ([I(6)F(13)M(31)](2) i.e. ([CGGG EIWKL HEEFLKK FEELLKL HEERLKKM](2))(2) which we call L31M), has been solved using MAD phasing and refined to 2.8A resolution. The structure shows that the maquette scaffold is an anti-parallel four-helix bundle with \"up-up-down-down\" topology. No pre-formed heme-binding pocket exists in the protein scaffold. We report unexpected inter-helical crossing angles, residue positions and translations between the helices. The crossing angles between the parallel helices are -5 degrees rather than the expected +20 degrees for typical left-handed coiled-coils. Deviation of the scaffold from the design is likely due to the distribution and size of hydrophobic residues. The structure of L31M points out that four identical helices may interact differently in a bundle and heptad repeats with an alternating [HPPHHPP]\/[HPPHHPH] (H: hydrophobic, P: polar) pattern are not a sufficient design criterion to generate left-hand coiled-coils."

        "Abstract":"Ankyrin repeat (AR) proteins mediate innumerable protein-protein interactions in virtually all phyla. This finding suggested the use of AR proteins as designed binding molecules. Based on sequence and structural analyses, we designed a consensus AR with fixed framework and randomized interacting residues. We generated several combinatorial libraries of AR proteins consisting of defined numbers of this repeat. Randomly chosen library members are expressed in soluble form in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli constituting up to 30% of total cellular protein and show high thermodynamic stability. We determined the crystal structure of one of those library members to 2.0-A resolution, providing insight into the consensus AR fold. Besides the highly complementary hydrophobic repeat-repeat interfaces and the absence of structural irregularities in the consensus AR protein, the regular and extended hydrogen bond networks in the beta-turn and loop regions are noteworthy. Furthermore, all residues found in the turn region of the Ramachandran plot are glycines. Many of these features also occur in natural AR proteins, but not in this rigorous and standardized fashion. We conclude that the AR domain fold is an intrinsically very stable and well-expressed scaffold, able to display randomized interacting residues. This scaffold represents an excellent basis for the design of novel binding molecules."

        "Abstract":"Amino acid structural propensities measured in \"host-guest\" model studies are often used in protein structure prediction or to choose appropriate residues in de novo protein design. While this concept has proven useful for helical structures, it is more difficult to apply successfully to beta-sheets. We have developed a cyclic beta-hairpin scaffold as a host for measurement of individual residue contributions to hairpin structural stability. Previously, we have characterized substitutions in non-backbone-hydrogen-bonded strand sites; relative stability differences measured in the cyclic host are highly predictive of changes in folding free energy for linear beta-hairpin peptides.

        "Abstract":"The turn-forming ability of a series of three-residue sequences was investigated by substituting them into a well-characterized beta-hairpin peptide. The starting scaffold, bhpW, is a disulfide-cyclized 10-residue peptide that folds into a stable beta-hairpin with two antiparallel strands connected by a two-residue reverse turn. Substitution of the central two residues with the three-residue test sequences leads to less stable hairpins, as judged by thiol-disulfide equilibrium measurements. However, analysis of NMR parameters indicated that each molecule retains a significant folded population, and that the type of turn adopted by the three-residue sequence is the same in all cases. The solution structure of a selected peptide with a PDG turn contained an antiparallel beta-hairpin with a 3:5 type I + G1 bulge turn. Analysis of the energetic contributions of individual turn residues in the series of peptides indicates that substitution effects have significant context dependence, limiting the predictive power of individual amino acid propensities for turn formation. The most stable and least stable sequences were also substituted into a more stable disulfide-cyclized scaffold and a linear beta-hairpin scaffold. The relative stabilities remained the same, suggesting that experimental measurements in the bhpW context are a useful way to evaluate turn stability for use in protein design projects. Moreover, these scaffolds are capable of displaying a diverse set of turns, which can be exploited for the mimicry of protein loops or for generating libraries of reverse turns."

        "Abstract":"Amino acid structural propensities measured in \"host-guest\" model studies are often used in protein structure prediction or to choose appropriate residues in de novo protein design. While this concept has proven useful for helical structures, it is more difficult to apply successfully to beta-sheets. We have developed a cyclic beta-hairpin scaffold as a host for measurement of individual residue contributions to hairpin structural stability. Previously, we have characterized substitutions in non-backbone-hydrogen-bonded strand sites; relative stability differences measured in the cyclic host are highly predictive of changes in folding free energy for linear beta-hairpin peptides. Here, we examine the hydrogen-bonded strand positions of our host. Surprisingly, we find a large favorable contribution to stability from a valine (or isoleucine) substitution immediately preceding the C-terminal cysteine of the host peptide, but not at the cross-strand position of the host or in either strand of a folded linear beta-hairpin (trpzip peptide). Further substitutions in the peptides and NMR structural analysis indicate that the stabilizing effect of valine is general for CX(8)C cyclic hairpins and cannot be explained by particular side-chain-side-chain interactions. Instead, a localized decrease in twist of the peptide backbone on the N-terminal side of the cysteine allows the valine side chain to adopt a unique conformation that decreases the solvent accessibility of the peptide backbone. The conformation differs from the highly twisted (coiled) conformation of the trpzip hairpins and is more typical of conformations present in multistranded beta-sheets. This unexpected structural fine-tuning may explain why cyclic hairpins selected from phage-displayed libraries often have valine in the same position, preceding the C-terminal cysteine. It also emphasizes the diversity of structures accessible to beta-strands and the importance of considering not only \"beta-propensity\", but also hydrogen-bonding pattern and strand twist, when designing beta structures. Finally, we observe correlated, cooperative stabilization from side-chain substitutions on opposite faces of the hairpin. This suggests that cooperative folding in beta-hairpins and other small beta-structures is driven by cooperative strand-strand association."

        "Abstract":"The ankyrin repeat is one of the most common, modular, protein-protein interaction motifs in nature. To understand the structural determinants of this family of proteins and extract the consensus information that defines the architecture of this motif, we have designed a series of idealized ankyrin repeat proteins containing one, two, three, or four repeats by using statistical analysis of approximately 4,000 ankyrin repeat sequences from the PFAM database. Biophysical and x-ray crystallographic studies of the three and four repeat constructs (3ANK and 4ANK) to 1.26 and 1.5 A resolution, respectively, demonstrate that these proteins are well-folded, monomeric, display high thermostability, and adopt a very regular, tightly packed ankyrin repeat fold. Mapping the degree of amino acid conservation at each position on the 4ANK structure shows that most nonconserved residues are clustered on the surface of the molecule that has been designated as the binding site in naturally occurring ankyrin repeat proteins. Thus, the consensus amino acid sequence contains all information required to define the ankyrin repeat fold. Our results suggest that statistical analysis and the consensus sequence approach can be used as an effective method to design proteins with complex topologies. These generic ankyrin repeat proteins can serve as prototypes for dissecting the rules of molecular recognition mediated by ankyrin repeats and for engineering proteins with novel biological functions."

        "Abstract":"The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) is a 34-amino acid alpha-helical motif that occurs in over 300 different proteins. In the different proteins, three to sixteen or more TPR motifs occur in tandem arrays and function to mediate protein-protein interactions. The binding specificity of each TPR protein is different, although the underlying structural motif is the same. Here we describe a statistical approach to the design of an idealized TPR motif. We present the high-resolution X-ray crystal structures (to 1.55 and 1.6 A) of designed TPR proteins and describe their solution properties and stability. A detailed analysis of these structures provides an understanding of the TPR motif, how it is repeated to give helical arrays with different superhelical twists, and how a very stable framework may be constructed for future functional designs."

        "Abstract":"The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) is a 34-amino acid alpha-helical motif that occurs in over 300 different proteins. In the different proteins, three to sixteen or more TPR motifs occur in tandem arrays and function to mediate protein-protein interactions. The binding specificity of each TPR protein is different, although the underlying structural motif is the same. Here we describe a statistical approach to the design of an idealized TPR motif. We present the high-resolution X-ray crystal structures (to 1.55 and 1.6 A) of designed TPR proteins and describe their solution properties and stability. A detailed analysis of these structures provides an understanding of the TPR motif, how it is repeated to give helical arrays with different superhelical twists, and how a very stable framework may be constructed for future functional designs."

        "Abstract":"De novo protein design provides an attractive approach to critically test the features that are required for metalloprotein structure and function. Previously we designed and crystallographically characterized an idealized dimeric model for the four-helix bundle class of diiron and dimanganese proteins [Dueferri 1 (DF1)]. Although the protein bound metal ions in the expected manner, access to its active site was blocked by large bulky hydrophobic residues. Subsequently, a substrate-access channel was introduced proximal to the metal-binding center, resulting in a protein with properties more closely resembling those of natural enzymes. Here we delineate the energetic and structural consequences associated with the introduction of these binding sites. To determine the extent to which the binding site was preorganized in the absence of metal ions, the apo structure of DF1 in solution was solved by NMR and compared with the crystal structure of the di-Zn(II) derivative. The overall fold of the apo protein was highly similar to that of the di-Zn(II) derivative, although there was a rotation of one of the helices. We also examined the thermodynamic consequences associated with building a small molecule-binding site within the protein. The protein exists in an equilibrium between folded dimers and unfolded monomers. DF1 is a highly stable protein (K(diss) = 0.001 fM), but the dissociation constant increases to 0.6 nM (deltadeltaG = 5.4 kcalmol monomer) as the active-site cavity is increased to accommodate small molecules."

        "Abstract":"The de novo protein DF1 is a minimal model for diiron and dimanganese metalloproteins, such as soluble methane monooxygenase. DF1 is a homodimeric four-helix bundle whose dinuclear center is formed by two bridging Glu side chains, two chelating Glu side chains, and two monodentate His ligands. Here, we report the di-Mn(II) and di-Co(II) derivatives of variants of this protein. Together with previously solved structures, 23 crystallographically independent four-helix bundle structures of DF1 variants have been determined, which differ in the bound metal ions and size of the active site cavity. For the di-Mn(II) derivatives, as the size of the cavity increases, the number and polarity of exogenous ligands increases. This collection of structures was analyzed to determine the relationship between protein conformation and the geometry of the active site. The primary mode of backbone movement involves a coordinated tilting and sliding of the first helix in the helix-loop-helix motif. Sliding depends on crystal-packing forces, the steric bulk of a critical residue that determines the dimensions of the active site access cavity, and the intermetal distance. Additionally, a torsional motion of the bridging carboxylates modulates the intermetal distance. This analysis provides a critical evaluation of how conformation, flexibility, and active site accessibility affect the geometry and ligand-binding properties of a metal center. The geometric parameters defining the DF structures were compared to natural diiron proteins; DF proteins have a restricted active site cavity, which may have implications for substrate recognition and chemical stability."

DF1 is a homodimeric four-helix bundle whose dinuclear center is formed by two bridging Glu side chains, two chelating Glu side chains, and two monodentate His ligands. Here, we report the di-Mn(II) and di-Co(II) derivatives of variants of this protein. Together with previously solved structures, 23 crystallographically independent four-helix bundle structures of DF1 variants have been determined, which differ in the bound metal ions and size of the active site cavity. For the di-Mn(II) derivatives, as the size of the cavity increases, the number and polarity of exogenous ligands increases. This collection of structures was analyzed to determine the relationship between protein conformation and the geometry of the active site. The primary mode of backbone movement involves a coordinated tilting and sliding of the first helix in the helix-loop-helix motif. Sliding depends on crystal-packing forces, the steric bulk of a critical residue that determines the dimensions of the active site access cavity, and the intermetal distance. Additionally, a torsional motion of the bridging carboxylates modulates the intermetal distance. This analysis provides a critical evaluation of how conformation, flexibility, and active site accessibility affect the geometry and ligand-binding properties of a metal center. The geometric parameters defining the DF structures were compared to natural diiron proteins; DF proteins have a restricted active site cavity, which may have implications for substrate recognition and chemical stability."

        "Abstract":"Combinatorial libraries of de novo amino acid sequences can provide a rich source of diversity for the discovery of novel proteins. Randomly generated sequences, however, rarely fold into well ordered protein-like structures. To enhance the quality of a library, diversity must be focused into those regions of sequence space most likely to yield well folded structures. We have constructed focused libraries of de novo sequences by designing the binary pattern of polar and nonpolar amino acids to favor structures that contain abundant secondary structure, while simultaneously burying hydrophobic side chains in the protein interior and exposing hydrophilic side chains to solvent. Because binary patterning specifies only the polar\/nonpolar periodicity, but not the identities of the side chains, detailed structural features, including packing interactions, cannot be designed a priori. Can binary patterned libraries nonetheless encode well folded proteins? An unambiguous answer to this question requires determination of a 3D structure. We used NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of S-824, a novel protein from a recently constructed library of 102-residue sequences. This library is \"na\u00efve\" in that it has not been subjected to high-throughput screens or directed evolution. The experimentally determined structure of S-824 is a four-helix bundle, as specified by the design. As dictated by the binary-code strategy, nonpolar side chains are buried in the protein interior, and polar side chains are exposed to solvent. The polypeptide backbone and buried side chains are well ordered, demonstrating that S-824 is not a molten globule and forms a unique structure. These results show that amino acid sequences that have neither been selected by evolution, nor designed by computer, nor isolated by high-throughput screening, can form native-like structures. These findings validate the binary-code strategy as an effective method for producing vast collections of well folded de novo proteins."

        "Abstract":"The structural characterization of de novo designed metalloproteins together with determination of chemical reactivity can provide a detailed understanding of the relationship between protein structure and functional properties. Toward this goal, we have prepared a series of cyclic peptides that bind to water-soluble metalloporphyrins (FeIII and CoIII). Neutral and positively charged histidine-containing peptides bind with a high affinity, whereas anionic peptides bind only weakly to the negatively charged metalloporphyrin. Additionally, it was found that the peptide becomes helical only in the presence of the metalloporphyrin. CD experiments confirm that the metalloporphyrin binds specific cyclic peptides with high affinity and with isodichroic behavior. Thermal unfolding experiments show that the complex has \"native-like\" properties. Finally, NMR spectroscopy produced well dispersed spectra and experimental restraints that provide a high-resolution solution structure of the complexed peptide."

        "Abstract":"Several groups have applied and experimentally tested systematic, quantitative methods to protein design with the goal of developing general design algorithms. We have sought to expand the range of computational protein design by developing quantitative design methods for residues of all parts of a protein: the buried core, the solvent exposed surface, and the boundary between core and surface. Our goal is an objective, quantitative design algorithm that is based on the physical properties that determine protein structure and stability and which is not limited to specific folds or motifs. We chose the betabetaalpha motif typified by the zinc finger DNA binding module to test our design methodology. Using previously published sequence scoring functions developed with a combined experimental and computational approach and the Dead-End Elimination theorem to search for the optimal sequence, we designed 20 out of 28 positions in the test motif. The resulting sequence has less than 40% homology to any known sequence and does not contain any metal binding sites or cysteine residues. The resulting peptide, pda8d, is highly soluble and monomeric and circular dichroism measurements showed it to be folded with a weakly cooperative thermal unfolding transition. The NMR solution structure of pda8d was solved and shows that it is well-defined with a backbone ensemble rms deviation of 0. 55 A. Pda8d folds into the desired betabetaalpha motif with well-defined elements of secondary structure and tertiary organization. Superposition of the pda8d backbone to the design target is excellent, with an atomic rms deviation of 1.04 A."

        "Abstract":"Protein design provides an attractive approach to test the essential features required for folding and function. Previously, we described the design and structural characterization in solution of mimochromes, a series of miniaturized metalloproteins, patterned after the F-helix of the hemoglobin beta-chain. Mimochromes consist of two medium-sized helical peptides, covalently linked to the deuteroporphyrin. CD and NMR characterization of the prototype, mimochrome I, revealed that the overall structure conforms well to the design. However, formation of Delta and Lambda diastereomers was observed. To overcome the problem of diastereomer formation, we re-designed mimochrome I, by engineering intramolecular, interchain interactions. The resulting model was mimochrome IV: the solution structural characterization showed the presence of the Lambda isomer as a unique form. To examine the extent to which the stereochemical stability and uniqueness of mimochrome IV was retained in the solid state, the crystal structure of Co(III)-mimochrome IV was solved by X-ray diffraction, and compared to the solution structure of the same derivative. Co(III)-mimochrome IV structures, both in solution and in the solid state, are characterized by the following common features: a bis-His axial coordination, a Lambda configuration around the metal ion, and a predominant helical conformation of the peptide chains. However, in the crystal structure, intrachain Glu1-Arg9 ion pairs are preferred over the designed, and experimentally found in solution, interchain interactions. This ion pairing switch may be related to strong packing interactions."

        "Abstract":"Although de novo protein design is an important endeavor with implications for understanding protein folding, until now, structures have been determined for only a few 25- to 30-residue designed miniproteins. Here, the NMR solution structure of a complex 73-residue three-helix bundle protein, alpha3D, is reported. The structure of alpha3D was not based on any natural protein, and yet it shows thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties typical of native proteins. A variety of features contribute to its unique structure, including electrostatics, the packing of a diverse set of hydrophobic side chains, and a loop that incorporates common capping motifs. Thus, it is now possible to design a complex protein with a well defined and predictable three-dimensional structure."

Here, we used a general computational strategy that iterates between sequence design and structure prediction to design a 93-residue alpha\/beta protein called Top7 with a novel sequence and topology. Top7 was found experimentally to be folded and extremely stable, and the x-ray crystal structure of Top7 is similar (root mean square deviation equals 1.2 angstroms) to the design model. The ability to design a new protein fold makes possible the exploration of the large regions of the protein universe not yet observed in nature."

Because these methods do not model protein main-chain flexibility, they lack the breadth to explore novel backbone conformations. Here the de novo design of a family of alpha-helical bundle proteins with a right-handed superhelical twist is described. In the design, the overall protein fold was specified by hydrophobic-polar residue patterning, whereas the bundle oligomerization state, detailed main-chain conformation, and interior side-chain rotamers were engineered by computational enumerations of packing in alternate backbone structures. Main-chain flexibility was incorporated through an algebraic parameterization of the backbone. The designed peptides form alpha-helical dimers, trimers, and tetramers in accord with the design goals. The crystal structure of the tetramer matches the designed structure in atomic detail."

        "Abstract":"Protein deposition as amyloid fibrils underlies many debilitating human disorders. The complexity and size of disease-related polypeptides, however, often hinders a detailed rational approach to study effects that contribute to the process of amyloid formation. We report here a simplified peptide sequence successfully designed de novo to fold into a coiled-coil conformation under ambient conditions but to transform into amyloid fibrils at elevated temperatures. We have determined the crystal structure of the coiled-coil form and propose a detailed molecular model for the peptide in its fibrillar state. The relative stabilities of the two structural forms and the kinetics of their interconversion were found to be highly sensitive to small sequence changes. The results reveal the importance of specific packing interactions on the kinetics of amyloid formation and show the potential of this exceptionally favorable system for probing details of the molecular origins of amyloid disease."
