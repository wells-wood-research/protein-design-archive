This peptide is a fragment of a 16-residue polypeptide that was designed to form an amphiphilic alpha helix with a ridge of Leu residues along one helical face. By interdigitation of the leucines of four such helices, the design called for self-association into a four-alpha-helical bundle. The crystal structure (2.7 angstrom resolution; R factor = 0.215) reveals a structure more complex than the design, with both a tetramer and a hexamer. The alpha-helical tetramer with leucine interior has more oblique crossing angles than most four-alpha-helical bundles; the hexamer has a globular hydrophobic core of 12 leucine residues and three associated sulfate ions. Computational analysis suggests that the hexameric association is tighter than the tetrameric one. The consistency of the structure with the design is discussed, as well as the divergence.",

The sequence was obtained through an iterative design process. A key feature of the final design is the incorporation of a type II' beta turn to aid in beta-hairpin formation.

To study the role of electrostatic interactions for assembly of helical bundles, we previously designed a thermostable, heterotrimeric coiled coil, ABC, in which charged residues were employed to drive preferential association of three distinct, 34-residue helices. To investigate the basis for heterotrimer specificity, we have used multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) analysis to determine the 1.8 A resolution crystal structure of ABC. The structure shows that ABC forms a heterotrimeric coiled coil with the intended arrangement of parallel chains. Over half of the ion pairs engineered to restrict helix associations were apparent in the experimental electron density map. As seen in other trimeric coiled coils, ABC displays acute knobs-into-holes packing and a buried anion coordinated by core polar amino acids. These interactions validate the design strategy and illustrate how packing and polar contacts determine structural uniqueness.",

        "abstract":"A 12-residue peptide designed to form an alpha-helix and self-associate into an antiparallel 4-alpha-helical bundle yields a 0.9 A crystal structure revealing unanticipated features. The structure was determined by direct phasing with the \"Shake-and-Bake\" program, and contains four crystallographically distinct 12-mer peptide molecules plus solvent for a total of 479 atoms. The crystal is formed from nearly ideal alpha-helices hydrogen bonded head-to-tail into columns, which in turn pack side-by-side into sheets spanning the width of the crystal. Within each sheet, the alpha-helices run antiparallel and are closely spaced (9-10 A center-to-center). The sheets are more loosely packed against each other (13-14 A between helix centers). Each sheet is amphiphilic: apolar leucine side chains project from one face, charged lysine and glutamate side chains from the other face. The sheets are stacked with two polar faces opposing and two apolar faces opposing. The result is a periodic biomaterial composed of packed protein bilayers, with alternating polar and apolar interfaces. All of the 30 water molecules in the unit cell lie in the polar interface or between the stacked termini of helices. A section through the sheet reveals that the helices packed at the apolar interface resemble the four-alpha-helical bundle of the design, but the helices overhang parts of the adjacent bundles, and the helix crossing angles are less steep than intended (7-11 degrees rather than 18 degrees).",

To examine the role of electrostatic interactions in this mechanism, we have designed two hydrophilic, charged amphipathic alpha-helical peptides, one basic (QAPAYKKAAKKLAES) and the other acidic (QAPAYEEAAEELAKS), and their structures were studied by CD and NMR. The design of the peptides is based on the sequence of the segment of residues 56-70 of human platelet factor 4 [PF4(56-70), QAPLYKKIIKKLLES]. Both peptides were unstructured in water, and in the presence of neutral, zwitterionic, or cationic detergents. However, in SDS at neutral pH, the basic peptide folded into an alpha-helix. By contrast, the pH needed to be lowered to 1.8 before alpha-helix formation was observed for the acidic peptide. Strong, attractive electrostatic interactions, between the anionic groups of SDS and the cationic groups of the lysines, appeared to be necessary to initiate the folding of the basic peptide. NMR analysis showed that the basic peptide was fully embedded in SDS-peptide micelles, and that its three-dimensional alpha-helical structure could be superimposed on that of the native structure of PF4(56-70). These results enabled us to propose a working model of the basic peptide-SDS complex, and a mechanism for SDS-induced alpha-helical folding. This study demonstrates that, while the folding of peptides is mostly driven by hydrophobic effects, electrostatic interactions play a significant role in the formation and the stabilization of SDS-induced structure.",

        "abstract":"De novo protein design provides an attractive approach for the construction of models to probe the features required for function of complex metalloproteins. The metal-binding sites of many metalloproteins lie between multiple elements of secondary structure, inviting a retrostructural approach to constructing minimal models of their active sites. The backbone geometries comprising the metal-binding sites of zinc fingers, diiron proteins, and rubredoxins may be described to within approximately 1 A rms deviation by using a simple geometric model with only six adjustable parameters. These geometric models provide excellent starting points for the design of metalloproteins, as illustrated in the construction of Due Ferro 1 (DF1), a minimal model for the Glu-Xxx-Xxx-His class of dinuclear metalloproteins. This protein was synthesized and structurally characterized as the di-Zn(II) complex by x-ray crystallography, by using data that extend to 2.5 A. This four-helix bundle protein is comprised of two noncovalently associated helix-loop-helix motifs. The dinuclear center is formed by two bridging Glu and two chelating Glu side chains, as well as two monodentate His ligands. The primary ligands are mostly buried in the protein interior, and their geometries are stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds to second-shell ligands. In particular, a Tyr residue forms a hydrogen bond to a chelating Glu ligand, similar to a motif found in the diiron-containing R2 subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase and the ferritins. DF1 also binds cobalt and iron ions and should provide an attractive model for a variety of diiron proteins that use oxygen for processes including iron storage, radical formation, and hydrocarbon oxidation.",

        "abstract":"The computational redesign of the second zinc finger of Zif268 to produce a 28 residue peptide (FSD-1) that assumes a betabetaalpha fold without metal binding was recently reported. In order to explore the tolerance of this metal-free fold towards sequence variability, six additional peptides resulting from the ORBIT computational protein design process were synthesized and characterized. The experimental stabilities of five of these peptides are strongly correlated with the energies calculated by ORBIT. However, when a peptide with a mutation in the beta-turn is examined, the calculated stability does not accurately predict the experimentally determined stability. The NMR solution structure of a peptide incorporating this mutation (FSD-EY) reveals that the register between the beta-strands is different from the model structure used to select and score the sequences. FSD-EY has a type I' turn instead of the target EbaaagbE turn (rubredoxin knuckle). Two additional peptides that have improved side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonding and turn propensity for the target turn were characterized. Both are of stability comparable to that of FSD-1. These results demonstrate the robustness of the ORBIT protein design methods and underscore the need for continued improvements in negative design.",

        "abstract":"Residues of opposite charge often populate heptad positions g (heptad i on chain 1) and e' (heptad i + 1 on chain 2) in dimeric coiled coils and may stabilize the dimer by formation of interchain ion pairs. To investigate the contribution to stability of such electrostatic interactions we have designed a disulfide-linked heterodimeric zipper (AB zipper) consisting of the acidic chain Ac-E-VAQLEKE-VAQAEAE-NYQLEQE-VAQLEHE-CG-NH(2) and the basic chain Ac-E-VQALKKR-VQALKAR-NYAAKQK-VQALRHK-CG-NH(2) in which all e and g positions are occupied by either E or K\/R to form a maximum of seven interhelical salt bridges. Temperature-induced denaturation experiments monitored by circular dichroism reveal a stable coiled coil conformation below 50 degrees C and in the pH range 1.2-8.0. Stability is highest at pH approximately 4.0 [DeltaG(U) (37 degrees C) = 5.18 +\/- 0.51 kcal mol(-)(1)]. The solution structure of the AB zipper at pH 5.65 has been elucidated on the basis of homonuclear (1)H NMR data collected at 800 MHz [heavy atom rmsd's for the ensemble of 50 calculated structures are 0.47 +\/- 0.13 A (backbone) and 0.95 +\/- 0.16 A (all)]. Both chains of the AB zipper are almost entirely in alpha-helical conformation and form a superhelix with a left-handed twist. Overhauser connectivities reveal close contacts between g position residues (heptad i on chain 1) and residues d\/f (heptad i on chain 1), residues a\/d (heptad i + 1 on chain 1), and residue a' (heptad i + 1 on chain 2). Residues in position e (heptad i on chain 1) are in contact with residues a\/b\/d\/f (heptad i on chain 1) and residue d' (heptad i on chain 2). These connectivities hint at a relatively defined alignment of the side chains across the helix interface. Partial H-bond formation between the functional groups of residues g and e'(+1) is observed in the calculated structures. NMR pH titration experiments disclose pK(a) values for Glu delta-carboxylate groups: 4.14 +\/- 0.02 (E(1)), 4.82 +\/- 0.07 (E(6)), 4.52 +\/- 0.01 (E(8)), 4.37 +\/- 0.03 (E(13)), 4.11 +\/- 0.02 (E(15)), 4.41 +\/- 0.07 (E(20)), 4.82 +\/- 0.03 (E(22)), 4.65 +\/- 0.04 (E(27)), 4.63 +\/- 0.03 (E(29)), 4.22 +\/- 0.02 (E(1)(')). By comparison with pK(a) of Glu in unfolded peptides ( approximately 4. 3 +\/- 0.1), our pK(a) data suggest marginal or even unfavorable contribution of charged Glu to the stability of the AB zipper. The electrostatic energy gained from interhelical ion pairs is likely to be surpassed by hydrophobic energy terms upon protonation of Glu, due to increased hydrophobicity of uncharged Glu and, thus, better packing against apolar residues at the chain interface.",

The structures and conditions of formation of several domain-swapped dimers and trimers are known, but the formation of higher order 3D domain-swapped oligomers has been less thoroughly studied. Here we contrast the structural consequences of domain swapping from two designed three-helix bundles: one with an up-down-up topology, and the other with an up-down-down topology. The up-down-up topology gives rise to a domain-swapped dimer whose structure has been determined to 1.5 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. In contrast, the domain-swapped protein with an up-down-down topology forms fibrils as shown by electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. This demonstrates that design principles can predict the oligomeric state of 3D domain-swapped molecules, which should aid in the design of domain-swapped proteins and biomaterials.",

Here we describe the de novo design and characterization of a two heptad-repeat peptide stabilized by a complex network of inter- and intrahelical salt bridges. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation show that this peptide is highly alpha-helical and 100% dimeric tinder physiological buffer conditions. Interestingly, the peptide was shown to switch its oligomerization state from a dimer to a trimer upon increasing ionic strength. The correctness of the rational design principles used here is supported by details of the atomic structure of the peptide deduced from X-ray crystallography. The structure of the peptide shows that it is not a molten globule but assumes a unique, native-like conformation. This de novo peptide thus represents an attractive model system for the design of a molecular recognition system.",

Starting with a de novo-designed linear peptide that shows a beta-hairpin structure population of around 30%, we selected four positions to build up a combinatorial library of 20(4) sequences. Deconvolution of the library using circular dichroism reduced such a sequence complexity to 36 defined sequences. Circular dichroism and NMR of these peptides resulted in the identification of two linear 14-aa-long peptides that in plain buffered solutions showed a percentage of beta-hairpin structure higher than 70%. Our results show how combinatorial approaches can be used to obtain highly structured peptide sequences that could be used as templates in which functionality can be introduced.",

For example, autonomously folding model systems have been essential for establishing the relationship between alpha-helix length and alpha-helix stability, which would be impossible to probe with alpha-helices embedded in folded proteins. Here, we use designed peptides to examine the effect of strand length on antiparallel beta-sheet stability. alpha-Helices become more stable as they grow longer. Our data show that a two-stranded beta-sheet (\"beta-hairpin\") becomes more stable when the strands are lengthened from five to seven residues, but that further strand lengthening to nine residues does not lead to further beta-hairpin stabilization for several extension sequences examined. (In one case, all-threonine extension, there may be an additional stabilization on strand lengthening from seven to nine residues.) These results suggest that there may be an intrinsic limit to strand length for most sequences in antiparallel beta-sheet secondary structure.",

Starting with a de novo-designed linear peptide that shows a beta-hairpin structure population of around 30%, we selected four positions to build up a combinatorial library of 20(4) sequences. Deconvolution of the library using circular dichroism reduced such a sequence complexity to 36 defined sequences. Circular dichroism and NMR of these peptides resulted in the identification of two linear 14-aa-long peptides that in plain buffered solutions showed a percentage of beta-hairpin structure higher than 70%. Our results show how combinatorial approaches can be used to obtain highly structured peptide sequences that could be used as templates in which functionality can be introduced.",

We have recently designed and solved the structure of a two-heptad repeat coiled-coil peptide that is stabilized further by a complex network of inter- and intrahelical salt-bridges in addition to the hydrophobic interactions. Here, we extend and improve the de novo design of this two heptad-repeat peptide by four newly designed peptides characterized by different types of ionic interactions. The contribution of these different types of ionic interactions to coiled-coil stability are analyzed by CD spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation. We show that all peptides are highly alpha-helical and two of them are 100% dimeric under physiological conditions. Furthermore, we have solved the X-ray structure of the most stable of these peptides and the rational design principles are verified by comparing this structure to the structure of the parent peptide. We show that by combining the most favorable inter- and intrahelical salt-bridge arrangements it is possible to design coiled-coil oligomerization domains with improved stability properties.",

        "abstract":"Truncation and mutation of a poorly folded 39-residue peptide has produced 20-residue constructs that are >95% folded in water at physiological pH. These constructs optimize a novel fold, designated as the 'Trp-cage' motif, and are significantly more stable than any other miniprotein reported to date. Folding is cooperative and hydrophobically driven by the encapsulation of a Trp side chain in a sheath of Pro rings. As the smallest protein-like construct, Trp-cage miniproteins should provide a testing ground for both experimental studies and computational simulations of protein folding and unfolding pathways. Pro Trp interactions may be a particularly effective strategy for the a priori design of self-folding peptides.",

        "abstract":"Alpha-helical coiled coils represent a common protein oligomerization motif that are mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions occurring along their coiled-coil interface, the so-called hydrophobic seam. We have recently de novo designed and optimized a series of two-heptad repeat long coiled-coil peptides which are further stabilized by a complex network of inter- and intrahelical salt bridges. Here we have extended the de novo design of such two heptad-repeat long peptides by removing the central and most important g-e' Arg to Glu (g-e'RE) ionic interhelical interaction and replacing these residues by alanine residues. The effect of the missing interhelical ionic interaction on coiled-coil formation and stability has been analyzed by CD spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and X-ray crystallography. We show that the peptide, while being highly alpha-helical, is no longer able to form a parallel coiled-coil structure but rather assumes an octameric globular helical assembly devoid of any coiled-coil interactions.",

De novo protein design has been used to examine the structural basis for the creation and maintenance of a tryptophanyl radical in a three-helix bundle protein maquette. Here we report the detailed structural analysis of the protein by multidimensional NMR methods. An interesting feature of the structure is an apparent pi-cation interaction involving the sole tryptophan and a lysine side chain. Hybrid density functional calculations support the notion that this interaction raises the reduction potential of the W degrees \/WH redox pair and helps explain the redox characteristics of the protein. This model protein system therefore provides a powerful model for exploring the structural basis for controlled radical chemistry in protein.",

        "abstract":"Maquettes are de novo designed mimicries of nature used to test the construction and engineering criteria of oxidoreductases. One type of scaffold used in maquette construction is a four-alpha-helical bundle. The sequence of the four-alpha-helix bundle maquettes follows a heptad repeat pattern typical of left-handed coiled-coils. Initial designs were molten globular due partly to the minimalist approach taken by the designers. Subsequent iterative redesign generated several structured scaffolds with similar heme binding properties. Variant [I(6)F(13)](2), a structured scaffold, was partially resolved with NMR spectroscopy and found to have a set of mobile inter-helical packing interfaces. Here, the X-ray structure of a similar peptide ([I(6)F(13)M(31)](2) i.e. ([CGGG EIWKL HEEFLKK FEELLKL HEERLKKM](2))(2) which we call L31M), has been solved using MAD phasing and refined to 2.8A resolution. The structure shows that the maquette scaffold is an anti-parallel four-helix bundle with \"up-up-down-down\" topology. No pre-formed heme-binding pocket exists in the protein scaffold. We report unexpected inter-helical crossing angles, residue positions and translations between the helices. The crossing angles between the parallel helices are -5 degrees rather than the expected +20 degrees for typical left-handed coiled-coils. Deviation of the scaffold from the design is likely due to the distribution and size of hydrophobic residues. The structure of L31M points out that four identical helices may interact differently in a bundle and heptad repeats with an alternating [HPPHHPP]\/[HPPHHPH] (H: hydrophobic, P: polar) pattern are not a sufficient design criterion to generate left-hand coiled-coils.",

To understand the structural determinants of this family of proteins and extract the consensus information that defines the architecture of this motif, we have designed a series of idealized ankyrin repeat proteins containing one, two, three, or four repeats by using statistical analysis of approximately 4,000 ankyrin repeat sequences from the PFAM database. Biophysical and x-ray crystallographic studies of the three and four repeat constructs (3ANK and 4ANK) to 1.26 and 1.5 A resolution, respectively, demonstrate that these proteins are well-folded, monomeric, display high thermostability, and adopt a very regular, tightly packed ankyrin repeat fold. Mapping the degree of amino acid conservation at each position on the 4ANK structure shows that most nonconserved residues are clustered on the surface of the molecule that has been designated as the binding site in naturally occurring ankyrin repeat proteins. Thus, the consensus amino acid sequence contains all information required to define the ankyrin repeat fold.

        "abstract":"Ankyrin repeat (AR) proteins mediate innumerable protein-protein interactions in virtually all phyla. This finding suggested the use of AR proteins as designed binding molecules. Based on sequence and structural analyses, we designed a consensus AR with fixed framework and randomized interacting residues. We generated several combinatorial libraries of AR proteins consisting of defined numbers of this repeat. Randomly chosen library members are expressed in soluble form in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli constituting up to 30% of total cellular protein and show high thermodynamic stability. We determined the crystal structure of one of those library members to 2.0-A resolution, providing insight into the consensus AR fold. Besides the highly complementary hydrophobic repeat-repeat interfaces and the absence of structural irregularities in the consensus AR protein, the regular and extended hydrogen bond networks in the beta-turn and loop regions are noteworthy. Furthermore, all residues found in the turn region of the Ramachandran plot are glycines. Many of these features also occur in natural AR proteins, but not in this rigorous and standardized fashion. We conclude that the AR domain fold is an intrinsically very stable and well-expressed scaffold, able to display randomized interacting residues. This scaffold represents an excellent basis for the design of novel binding molecules.",

        "abstract":"Amino acid structural propensities measured in \"host-guest\" model studies are often used in protein structure prediction or to choose appropriate residues in de novo protein design. While this concept has proven useful for helical structures, it is more difficult to apply successfully to beta-sheets. We have developed a cyclic beta-hairpin scaffold as a host for measurement of individual residue contributions to hairpin structural stability. Previously, we have characterized substitutions in non-backbone-hydrogen-bonded strand sites; relative stability differences measured in the cyclic host are highly predictive of changes in folding free energy for linear beta-hairpin peptides. Here, we examine the hydrogen-bonded strand positions of our host. Surprisingly, we find a large favorable contribution to stability from a valine (or isoleucine) substitution immediately preceding the C-terminal cysteine of the host peptide, but not at the cross-strand position of the host or in either strand of a folded linear beta-hairpin (trpzip peptide). Further substitutions in the peptides and NMR structural analysis indicate that the stabilizing effect of valine is general for CX(8)C cyclic hairpins and cannot be explained by particular side-chain-side-chain interactions. Instead, a localized decrease in twist of the peptide backbone on the N-terminal side of the cysteine allows the valine side chain to adopt a unique conformation that decreases the solvent accessibility of the peptide backbone. The conformation differs from the highly twisted (coiled) conformation of the trpzip hairpins and is more typical of conformations present in multistranded beta-sheets. This unexpected structural fine-tuning may explain why cyclic hairpins selected from phage-displayed libraries often have valine in the same position, preceding the C-terminal cysteine. It also emphasizes the diversity of structures accessible to beta-strands and the importance of considering not only \"beta-propensity\", but also hydrogen-bonding pattern and strand twist, when designing beta structures. Finally, we observe correlated, cooperative stabilization from side-chain substitutions on opposite faces of the hairpin. This suggests that cooperative folding in beta-hairpins and other small beta-structures is driven by cooperative strand-strand association.",

        "abstract":"The turn-forming ability of a series of three-residue sequences was investigated by substituting them into a well-characterized beta-hairpin peptide. The starting scaffold, bhpW, is a disulfide-cyclized 10-residue peptide that folds into a stable beta-hairpin with two antiparallel strands connected by a two-residue reverse turn. Substitution of the central two residues with the three-residue test sequences leads to less stable hairpins, as judged by thiol-disulfide equilibrium measurements. However, analysis of NMR parameters indicated that each molecule retains a significant folded population, and that the type of turn adopted by the three-residue sequence is the same in all cases. The solution structure of a selected peptide with a PDG turn contained an antiparallel beta-hairpin with a 3:5 type I + G1 bulge turn. Analysis of the energetic contributions of individual turn residues in the series of peptides indicates that substitution effects have significant context dependence, limiting the predictive power of individual amino acid propensities for turn formation. The most stable and least stable sequences were also substituted into a more stable disulfide-cyclized scaffold and a linear beta-hairpin scaffold. The relative stabilities remained the same, suggesting that experimental measurements in the bhpW context are a useful way to evaluate turn stability for use in protein design projects. Moreover, these scaffolds are capable of displaying a diverse set of turns, which can be exploited for the mimicry of protein loops or for generating libraries of reverse turns.",

        "abstract":"De novo protein design provides an attractive approach to critically test the features that are required for metalloprotein structure and function. Previously we designed and crystallographically characterized an idealized dimeric model for the four-helix bundle class of diiron and dimanganese proteins [Dueferri 1 (DF1)]. Although the protein bound metal ions in the expected manner, access to its active site was blocked by large bulky hydrophobic residues. Subsequently, a substrate-access channel was introduced proximal to the metal-binding center, resulting in a protein with properties more closely resembling those of natural enzymes. Here we delineate the energetic and structural consequences associated with the introduction of these binding sites. To determine the extent to which the binding site was preorganized in the absence of metal ions, the apo structure of DF1 in solution was solved by NMR and compared with the crystal structure of the di-Zn(II) derivative. The overall fold of the apo protein was highly similar to that of the di-Zn(II) derivative, although there was a rotation of one of the helices. We also examined the thermodynamic consequences associated with building a small molecule-binding site within the protein. The protein exists in an equilibrium between folded dimers and unfolded monomers. DF1 is a highly stable protein (K(diss) = 0.001 fM), but the dissociation constant increases to 0.6 nM (deltadeltaG = 5.4 kcalmol monomer) as the active-site cavity is increased to accommodate small molecules.",

Toward this goal, we have prepared a series of cyclic peptides that bind to water-soluble metalloporphyrins (FeIII and CoIII). Neutral and positively charged histidine-containing peptides bind with a high affinity, whereas anionic peptides bind only weakly to the negatively charged metalloporphyrin. Additionally, it was found that the peptide becomes helical only in the presence of the metalloporphyrin. CD experiments confirm that the metalloporphyrin binds specific cyclic peptides with high affinity and with isodichroic behavior. Thermal unfolding experiments show that the complex has \"native-like\" properties. Finally, NMR spectroscopy produced well dispersed spectra and experimental restraints that provide a high-resolution solution structure of the complexed peptide.",

        "abstract":"Several groups have applied and experimentally tested systematic, quantitative methods to protein design with the goal of developing general design algorithms. We have sought to expand the range of computational protein design by developing quantitative design methods for residues of all parts of a protein: the buried core, the solvent exposed surface, and the boundary between core and surface. Our goal is an objective, quantitative design algorithm that is based on the physical properties that determine protein structure and stability and which is not limited to specific folds or motifs. We chose the betabetaalpha motif typified by the zinc finger DNA binding module to test our design methodology. Using previously published sequence scoring functions developed with a combined experimental and computational approach and the Dead-End Elimination theorem to search for the optimal sequence, we designed 20 out of 28 positions in the test motif. The resulting sequence has less than 40% homology to any known sequence and does not contain any metal binding sites or cysteine residues. The resulting peptide, pda8d, is highly soluble and monomeric and circular dichroism measurements showed it to be folded with a weakly cooperative thermal unfolding transition. The NMR solution structure of pda8d was solved and shows that it is well-defined with a backbone ensemble rms deviation of 0. 55 A. Pda8d folds into the desired betabetaalpha motif with well-defined elements of secondary structure and tertiary organization. Superposition of the pda8d backbone to the design target is excellent, with an atomic rms deviation of 1.04 A.",

        "abstract":"Protein design provides an attractive approach to test the essential features required for folding and function. Previously, we described the design and structural characterization in solution of mimochromes, a series of miniaturized metalloproteins, patterned after the F-helix of the hemoglobin beta-chain. Mimochromes consist of two medium-sized helical peptides, covalently linked to the deuteroporphyrin. CD and NMR characterization of the prototype, mimochrome I, revealed that the overall structure conforms well to the design. However, formation of Delta and Lambda diastereomers was observed. To overcome the problem of diastereomer formation, we re-designed mimochrome I, by engineering intramolecular, interchain interactions. The resulting model was mimochrome IV: the solution structural characterization showed the presence of the Lambda isomer as a unique form. To examine the extent to which the stereochemical stability and uniqueness of mimochrome IV was retained in the solid state, the crystal structure of Co(III)-mimochrome IV was solved by X-ray diffraction, and compared to the solution structure of the same derivative. Co(III)-mimochrome IV structures, both in solution and in the solid state, are characterized by the following common features: a bis-His axial coordination, a Lambda configuration around the metal ion, and a predominant helical conformation of the peptide chains. However, in the crystal structure, intrachain Glu1-Arg9 ion pairs are preferred over the designed, and experimentally found in solution, interchain interactions. This ion pairing switch may be related to strong packing interactions.",

Here, we used a general computational strategy that iterates between sequence design and structure prediction to design a 93-residue alpha\/beta protein called Top7 with a novel sequence and topology. Top7 was found experimentally to be folded and extremely stable, and the x-ray crystal structure of Top7 is similar (root mean square deviation equals 1.2 angstroms) to the design model. The ability to design a new protein fold makes possible the exploration of the large regions of the protein universe not yet observed in nature.",

Because these methods do not model protein main-chain flexibility, they lack the breadth to explore novel backbone conformations. Here the de novo design of a family of alpha-helical bundle proteins with a right-handed superhelical twist is described. In the design, the overall protein fold was specified by hydrophobic-polar residue patterning, whereas the bundle oligomerization state, detailed main-chain conformation, and interior side-chain rotamers were engineered by computational enumerations of packing in alternate backbone structures. Main-chain flexibility was incorporated through an algebraic parameterization of the backbone. The designed peptides form alpha-helical dimers, trimers, and tetramers in accord with the design goals. The crystal structure of the tetramer matches the designed structure in atomic detail.",

The complexity and size of disease-related polypeptides, however, often hinders a detailed rational approach to study effects that contribute to the process of amyloid formation. We report here a simplified peptide sequence successfully designed de novo to fold into a coiled-coil conformation under ambient conditions but to transform into amyloid fibrils at elevated temperatures. We have determined the crystal structure of the coiled-coil form and propose a detailed molecular model for the peptide in its fibrillar state. The relative stabilities of the two structural forms and the kinetics of their interconversion were found to be highly sensitive to small sequence changes. The results reveal the importance of specific packing interactions on the kinetics of amyloid formation and show the potential of this exceptionally favorable system for probing details of the molecular origins of amyloid disease.",

        "abstract":"Designing new protein folds requires a method for simultaneously optimizing the conformation of the backbone and the side-chains. One approach to this problem is the use of a parameterized backbone, which allows the systematic exploration of families of structures. We report the crystal structure of RH3, a right-handed, three-helix coiled coil that was designed using a parameterized backbone and detailed modeling of core packing. This crystal structure was determined using another rationally designed feature, a metal-binding site that permitted experimental phasing of the X-ray data. RH3 adopted the intended fold, which has not been observed previously in biological proteins. Unanticipated structural asymmetry in the trimer was a principal source of variation within the RH3 structure. The sequence of RH3 differs from that of a previously characterized right-handed tetramer, RH4, at only one position in each 11 amino acid sequence repeat. This close similarity indicates that the design method is sensitive to the core packing interactions that specify the protein structure. Comparison of the structures of RH3 and RH4 indicates that both steric overlap and cavity formation provide strong driving forces for oligomer specificity.",

The E3\/K3 coiled-coil is a 42-residue de novo designed coiled-coil comprising three heptad repeats per subunit, stabilized by hydrophobic contacts within the core and electrostatic interactions at the interface crossing the hydrophobic core which direct heterodimer formation. This E3\/K3 domain has previously been shown to have high alpha-helical content as well as possessing a low dissociation constant (70 nM). The E3\/K3 structure is completely alpha-helical and is an archetypical coiled-coil in solution, as determined using a combination of (1)H-NOE and homology based structural restraints. This structure provides a structural framework for visualizing the important interactions for stability and specificity, which are key to protein engineering applications such as affinity purification and de novo design.",

        "abstract":"The pH-dependent stability of a protein is strongly affected by electrostatic interactions between ionizable residues in the folded as well as unfolded state. Here we characterize the individual contributions of charged Glu and His residues to stability and determine the NMR structure of the designed, heterodimeric leucine zipper AB consisting of an acidic A chain and a basic B chain. Thermodynamic parameters are compared with those of the homologous leucine zipper AB(SS) in which the A and B chains are disulfide-linked. NMR structures of AB based on (1)H NMR data collected at 600 MHz converge, and formation of the same six interchain salt bridges found previously in disulfide-linked AB(SS) [Marti, D. N., and Bosshard, H. R. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 330, 621-637] is indicated. While the structures of AB and AB(SS) are very similar, their pH-dependent relative stabilities are strikingly different. The stability of AB peaks at pH approximately 4.5 and is higher at pH 8 than at pH 2. In contrast, AB(SS) is most stable at acidic pH where no interhelical salt bridges are formed. The different energetic contributions of charged Glu and His residues to stability of the two coiled coil structures were evaluated from pK(a) shifts induced by folding. The six charged Glu residues involved in salt bridges stabilize leucine zipper AB by 4.5 kJ\/mol yet destabilize disulfide-linked AB(SS) by -1.1 kJ\/mol. Two non-ion-paired Glu charges destabilize AB by only -1.8 kJ\/mol but AB(SS) by -5.6 kJ\/mol. The higher relative stability of AB at neutral pH is not caused by more favorable electrostatic interactions in the folded leucine zipper. It is due mainly to unfavorable electrostatic interactions in the unfolded A and B chains and may therefore be called an inverse electrostatic effect. This study illustrates the importance of residual interactions in the unfolded state and how the energetics of the unfolded state affect the stability of the folded protein.",

In order to shed light on the role of the protein matrix in modulating the heme properties, we developed new models: mimochromes. They are pseudo-C(2) symmetric systems, composed of two helical peptides covalently linked to the deuteroporphyrin. The use of C(2) symmetry is particularly advantageous, because it simplifies the design, synthesis and characterization. However, it leaves the problem of possible diastereomeric forms. In the cobalt complex of the first derivative, mimochrome I, Lambda and Delta isomers were indeed experimentally observed. All the insights derived from the Co(III)-mimochrome I structure were used to obtain a re-designed molecule, mimochrome IV. The spectroscopic characterization of the iron and cobalt derivatives suggested the presence of the Lambda isomer as unique species. The NMR solution structure of the diamagnetic Co(III)-mimochrome IV confirmed the ability of the molecule to adopt a unique topology, and revealed the peptide chains to be in helical conformation, as designed. The insertion of intramolecular, inter-chain interactions was successful in favoring the formation of one of the two possible diastereomers. The stereochemically stable structure of mimochrome IV provides an attractive model for modulating the redox potential of the heme, by simple changing the peptide chain composition around the heme.",

A 21 residue long, dehydrophenylalanine-containing peptide has been de novo designed and its crystal structure determined. The apolar peptide folds into a helical hairpin supersecondary structure with two right-handed helices, connected by a tetraglycine linker. The helices of the hairpin interact with each other through a combination of C-H.O and N-H.O hydrogen bonds. The folding of the apolar peptide has been realized without the help of either metal ions or disulphide bonds. A remarkable feature of the peptide is the unanticipated occurrence of an anion binding motif in the linker region, strikingly similar in conformation and function to the \"nest\" motif seen in several proteins. The observation supports the view for the possible emergence of rudimentary functions over short sequence stretches in the early peptides under prebiotic conditions.",

Although many examples of synthetic alpha-helical structures are known, relatively few mixed alpha\/beta structures have been successfully designed. Only one mixed-secondary structure oligomer, an alpha\/beta homotetramer, has been reported thus far. In this report, we use structural analysis and computational design to convert this homotetramer into the smallest known alpha\/beta-heterotetramer. Computational screening of many possible sequence\/structure combinations led efficiently to the design of short, 21-residue peptides that fold cooperatively and autonomously into a specific complex in solution. A 1.95 A crystal structure reveals how steric complementarity and charge patterning encode heterospecificity. The first- and second-generation heterotetrameric miniproteins described here will be useful as simple models for the analysis of protein-protein interaction specificity and as structural platforms for the further elaboration of folding and function.",

        "abstract":"Although the analysis and design of turns that connect the strands in antiparallel beta-hairpins has reached an advanced state, much less is known concerning turns between antiparallel helices in helical hairpins. We have conducted an analysis of the structures and sequence preferences of two types of interhelical turns, each of which connects the two helices by a two-residue linker in an alphaL-beta conformation. Based on this analysis, it became apparent that the turn introduced into a designed four-helix bundle protein, DF1, did not occur within an optimal structural context. DF1 is a dimeric model for the diiron class of proteins. A longer loop with a beta-alphaR-beta conformation was inserted between two helices in the protein, and a sequence was chosen to stabilize its conformation. X-ray crystallography and NMR analysis of the protein showed the structure to be in excellent agreement with design.",

Here, we attempt to define the sequence rules for specifying a protein fold by computationally creating artificial protein sequences using only statistical information encoded in a multiple sequence alignment and no tertiary structure information. Experimental testing of libraries of artificial WW domain sequences shows that a simple statistical energy function capturing coevolution between amino acid residues is necessary and sufficient to specify sequences that fold into native structures. The artificial proteins show thermodynamic stabilities similar to natural WW domains, and structure determination of one artificial protein shows excellent agreement with the WW fold at atomic resolution. The relative simplicity of the information used for creating sequences suggests a marked reduction to the potential complexity of the protein-folding problem.",

The structure of alpha3D was not based on any natural protein, and yet it shows thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties typical of native proteins.

Here, the structure and stability of designed tetratricopeptide-repeat (TPR) proteins is described. The TPR is a 34-amino-acid motif which adopts a helix-turn-helix structure and occurs as tandem repeats. The design of a consensus TPR motif (CTPR) has previously been described. Here, the crystal structures and stabilities of proteins that contain eight or 20 identical tandem repeats of the CTPR motif (CTPR8 and CTPR20) are presented. Both CTPR8 and CTPR20 adopt a superhelical overall structure. The structures of the different-length CTPR proteins are compared with each other and with the structures of natural TPR domains. Also, the unusual and perhaps unique crystal-packing interactions resulting in pseudo-infinite crystalline superhelices observed in the different crystal forms of CTPR8 and CTPR20 are discussed. Finally, it is shown that the thermodynamic behavior of CTPR8 and CTPR20 can be predicted from the behavior of other TPRs in this series using an Ising model-based analysis. The designed protein series CTPR2-CTPR20 covers the natural size repertoire of TPR domains and as such is an excellent model system for natural TPR proteins.",

The structural analysis of the designed AR protein E3_5 revealed that this stability is due to a regular fold with highly conserved structural motifs and H-bonding networks. However, the designed AR protein E3_19 exhibits a significantly lower stability than E3_5 (9.6 vs. 14.8 kcal\/mol), despite 88% sequence identity. To investigate the structural correlations of this stability difference between E3_5 and E3_19, we determined the crystal structure of E3_19 at 1.9 A resolution. E3_19 as well has a regular AR domain fold with the characteristic H-bonding patterns. All structural features of the E3_5 and E3_19 molecules appear to be virtually identical (RMSD(Calpha) approximately 0.7 A). However, clear differences are observed in the surface charge distribution of the two AR proteins. E3_19 features clusters of charged residues and more exposed hydrophobic residues than E3_5. The atomic coordinates of E3_19 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. PDB ID: 2BKG.",

        "abstract":"One of the classical DNA-binding proteins, bacteriophage lambda Cro, forms a homodimer with a unique fold of alpha-helices and beta-sheets. We have computationally designed an artificial sequence of 60 amino acid residues to stabilize the backbone tertiary structure of the lambda Cro dimer by simulated annealing using knowledge-based structure-sequence compatibility functions. The designed amino acid sequence has 25% identity with that of natural lambda Cro and preserves Phe58, which is important for formation of the stably folded structure of lambda Cro. The designed dimer protein and its monomeric variant, which was redesigned by the insertion of a beta-hairpin sequence at the C-terminal region to prevent dimerization, were synthesized and biochemically characterized to be well folded. The designed protein was monomeric under a wide range of protein concentrations and its solution structure was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The solved structure is similar to that of a monomeric variant of natural lambda Cro with a root-mean-square deviation of the polypeptide backbones at 2.1A and has a well-packed protein core. Thus, our knowledge-based functions provide approximate but essential relationships between amino acid sequences and protein structures, and are useful for finding novel sequences that are foldable into a given target structure.",

        "abstract":"Minimized beta hairpins have provided additional data on the geometric preferences of Trp interactions in TW-loop-WT motifs. This motif imparts significant fold stability to peptides as short as 8 residues. High-resolution NMR structures of a 16- (KKWTWNPATGKWTWQE, DeltaG(U)(298) >or= +7 kJ\/mol) and 12-residue (KTWNPATGKWTE, DeltaG(U)(298) = +5.05 kJ\/mol) hairpin reveal a common turn geometry and edge-to-face (EtF) packing motif and a cation-pi interaction between Lys(1) and the Trp residue nearest the C-terminus. The magnitude of a CD exciton couplet (due to the two Trp residues) and the chemical shifts of a Trp Hepsilon3 site (shifted upfield by 2.4 ppm due to the EtF stacking geometry) provided near-identical measures of folding. CD melts of representative peptides with the -TW-loop-WT- motif provided the thermodynamic parameters for folding, which reflect enthalpically driven folding at laboratory temperatures with a small DeltaC(p) for unfolding (+420 J K(-)(1)\/mol). In the case of Asx-Pro-Xaa-Thr-Gly-Xaa loops, mutations established that the two most important residues in this class of direction-reversing loops are Asx and Gly: mutation to alanine is destabilizing by about 6 and 2 kJ\/mol, respectively. All indicators of structuring are retained in a minimized 8-residue construct (Ac-WNPATGKW-NH(2)) with the fold stability reduced to DeltaG(U)(278) = -0.7 kJ\/mol. NMR and CD comparisons indicate that -TWXNGKWT- (X = S, I) sequences also form the same hairpin-stabilizing W\/W interaction.",

        "abstract":"Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) are a novel class of binding molecules, which can be selected to recognize specifically a wide variety of target proteins. DARPins were previously selected against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) with low nanomolar affinities. We describe here their affinity maturation by error-prone PCR and ribosome display yielding clones with zero to seven (average 2.5) amino acid substitutions in framework positions. The DARPin with highest affinity (90 pM) carried four mutations at framework positions, leading to a 3000-fold affinity increase compared to the consensus framework variant, mainly coming from a 500-fold increase of the on-rate. This DARPin was found to be highly sensitive in detecting Her2 in human carcinoma extracts. We have determined the crystal structure of this DARPin at 1.7 A, and found that a His to Tyr mutation at the framework position 52 alters the inter-repeat H-bonding pattern and causes a significant conformational change in the relative disposition of the repeat subdomains. These changes are thought to be the reason for the enhanced on-rate of the mutated DARPin. The DARPin not bearing the residue 52 mutation has an unusually slow on-rate, suggesting that binding occurred via conformational selection of a relatively rare state, which was stabilized by this His52Tyr mutation, increasing the on-rate again to typical values. An analysis of the structural location of the framework mutations suggests that randomization of some framework residues either by error-prone PCR or by design in a future library could increase affinities and the target binding spectrum.",

        "abstract":"Arsenic, a contaminant of water supplies worldwide, is one of the most toxic inorganic ions. Despite arsenic's health impact, there is relatively little structural detail known about its interactions with proteins. Bacteria such as Escherichia coli have evolved arsenic resistance using the Ars operon that is regulated by ArsR, a repressor protein that dissociates from DNA when As(III) binds. This protein undergoes a critical conformational change upon binding As(III) with three cysteine residues. Unfortunately, structures of ArsR with or without As(III) have not been reported. Alternatively, de novo designed peptides can bind As(III) in an endo configuration within a thiolate-rich environment consistent with that proposed for both ArsR and ArsD. We report the structure of the As(III) complex of Coil Ser L9C to a 1.8-A resolution, providing x-ray characterization of As(III) in a Tris thiolate protein environment and allowing a structural basis by which to understand arsenated ArsR.",

        "abstract":"The Trp-cage, as the smallest miniprotein, remains the subject of numerous computational and experimental studies of protein folding dynamics and pathways. The original Trp-cage (NLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS, Tm = 42 degrees C) can be significantly stabilized by mutations; melting points as high as 64 degrees C are reported. In helical portions of the structure, each allowed replacement of Leu, Ile, Lys or Ser residues by Ala results in a 1.5 (+\/-0.35) kJ\/mol fold stabilization. No changes in structure or fluxionality of the core results upon stabilization. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, specific Pro\/Trp interactions are not essential for core formation. The entropic advantage of Pro versus Ala (DeltaDeltaS(U) = 11 +\/- 2 J\/mol K) was measured at the solvent-exposed P17 site. Pro-Ala mutations at two of the three prolines (P12 and P18) that encage the indole ring result in less fold destabilization (2.3-3.4 kJ\/mol). However, a P19A mutation reduces fold stability by 16 kJ\/mol reflecting a favorable Y3\/P19 interaction as well as Trp burial. The Y3\/P19 hydrophobic staple interaction defines the folding motif as an 18-residue unit. Other stabilizing features that have been identified include a solvent-exposed Arg\/Asp salt bridge (3.4-6 kJ\/mol) and a buried H-bonded Ser side chain ( approximately 10 kJ\/mol).",

        "abstract":"As a model of the protein targets for volatile anesthetics, the dimeric four-alpha-helix bundle, (Aalpha(2)-L1M\/L38M)(2), was designed to contain a long hydrophobic core, enclosed by four amphipathic alpha-helices, for specific anesthetic binding. The structural and dynamical analyses of (Aalpha(2)-L1M\/L38M)(2) in the absence of anesthetics (another study) showed a highly dynamic antiparallel dimer with an asymmetric arrangement of the four helices and a lateral accessing pathway from the aqueous phase to the hydrophobic core. In this study, we determined the high-resolution NMR structure of (Aalpha(2)-L1M\/L38M)(2) in the presence of halothane, a clinically used volatile anesthetic. The high-solution NMR structure, with a backbone root mean-square deviation of 1.72 A (2JST), and the NMR binding measurements revealed that the primary halothane binding site is located between two side-chains of W15 from each monomer, different from the initially designed anesthetic binding sites. Hydrophobic interactions with residues A44 and L18 also contribute to stabilizing the bound halothane. Whereas halothane produces minor changes in the monomer structure, the quaternary arrangement of the dimer is shifted by about half a helical turn and twists relative to each other, which leads to the closure of the lateral access pathway to the hydrophobic core. Quantitative dynamics analyses, including Modelfree analysis of the relaxation data and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill transverse relaxation dispersion measurements, suggest that the most profound anesthetic effect is the suppression of the conformational exchange both near and remote from the binding site. Our results revealed a novel mechanism of an induced fit between anesthetic molecule and its protein target, with the direct consequence of protein dynamics changing on a global rather than a local scale. This mechanism may be universal to anesthetic action on neuronal proteins.",

A single mutation switches the conformation to the 3-alpha fold, which is >90% populated (pH 7.2, 20 degrees C).

        "abstract":"Unlike random heteropolymers, natural proteins fold into unique ordered structures. Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features--for example kinked \u03b1-helices, bulged \u03b2-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups--that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models. These results illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise and provide the foundation for engineering a new generation of functional proteins free from natural evolution.",

Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features--for example kinked \u03b1-helices, bulged \u03b2-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups--that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models.

        "abstract":"Collagen, known for its structural role in tissues and also for its participation in the regulation of homeostatic and pathological processes in mammals, is assembled from triple helices that can be either homotrimers or heterotrimers. High resolution structural information for natural collagens has been difficult to obtain because of their size and the heterogeneity of their native environment. For this reason, peptides that self-assemble into collagen-like triple helices are used to gain insight into the structure, stability, and biochemistry of this important protein family. Although many of the most common collagens in humans are heterotrimers, almost all studies of collagen helices have been on homotrimers. Here we report the first structure of a collagen heterotrimer. Our structure, obtained by solution NMR, highlights the role of electrostatic interactions as stabilizing factors within the triple helical folding motif. This addresses an issue that has been actively researched because of the predominance of charged residues in the collagen family. We also find that it is possible to selectively form a collagen heterotrimer with a well defined composition and register of the peptide chains within the helix, based on information encoded solely in the collagenous domain. Globular domains are implicated in determining the composition of several collagen types, but it is unclear what their role in controlling register may be. We show that is possible to design peptides that not only selectively choose a composition but also a specific register without the assistance of other protein constructs. This mechanism may be used in nature as well.",

The principles relate secondary structure patterns to tertiary packing motifs and enable design of different protein topologies. To achieve fine control over protein shape and size within a particular topology, we have extended the design rules by systematically analyzing the codependencies between the lengths and packing geometry of successive secondary structure elements and the backbone torsion angles of the loop linking them. We demonstrate the control afforded by the resulting extended rule set by designing a series of proteins with the same fold but considerable variation in secondary structure length, loop geometry, \u03b2-strand registry, and overall shape. Solution NMR structures of four designed proteins for two different folds show that protein shape and size can be precisely controlled within a given protein fold. These extended design principles provide the foundation for custom design of protein structures performing desired functions.",

Here, we report the design of a membrane-spanning, four-helical bundle that transports first-row transition metal ions Zn(2+) and Co(2+), but not Ca(2+), across membranes. The conduction path was designed to contain two di-metal binding sites that bind with negative cooperativity. X-ray crystallography and solid-state and solution nuclear magnetic resonance indicate that the overall helical bundle is formed from two tightly interacting pairs of helices, which form individual domains that interact weakly along a more dynamic interface. Vesicle flux experiments show that as Zn(2+) ions diffuse down their concentration gradients, protons are antiported. These experiments illustrate the feasibility of designing membrane proteins with predefined structural and dynamic properties.",

        "abstract":"Most, if not all, peptide- and protein-based hydrogels formed by self-assembly can be characterized as kinetically trapped 3D networks of fibrils. The propensity of disease-associated amyloid-forming peptides and proteins to assemble into polymorphic fibrils suggests that cross-\u03b2 fibrils comprising hydrogels may also be polymorphic. We use solid-state NMR to determine the molecular and supramolecular structure of MAX1, a de novo designed gel-forming peptide, in its fibrillar state. We find that MAX1 adopts a \u03b2-hairpin conformation and self-assembles with high fidelity into a double-layered cross-\u03b2 structure. Hairpins assemble with an in-register Syn orientation within each \u03b2-sheet layer and with an Anti orientation between layers. Surprisingly, although the MAX1 fibril network is kinetically trapped, solid-state NMR data show that fibrils within this network are monomorphic and most likely represent the thermodynamic ground state. Intermolecular interactions not available in alternative structural arrangements apparently dictate this monomorphic behavior.",

        "abstract":"Specific interactions of peptides with lipid membranes are essential for cellular communication and constitute a central aspect of the innate host defense against pathogens. A computational method for generating innovative membrane-pore-forming peptides inspired by natural templates is presented. Peptide representation in terms of sequence- and topology-dependent hydrophobic moments is introduced. This design concept proves to be appropriate for the de novo generation of first-in-class membrane-active peptides with the anticipated mode of action. The designed peptides outperform the natural template in terms of their antibacterial activity. They form a kinked helical structure and self-assemble in the membrane by an entropy-driven mechanism to form dynamically growing pores that are dependent on the lipid composition. The results of this study demonstrate the unique potential of natural template-based peptide design for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.",

We describe a computational protocol, called SEWING, which is inspired by this process and builds new proteins from connected or disconnected pieces of existing structures. Helical proteins designed with SEWING contain structural features absent from other de novo designed proteins and, in some cases, remain folded at more than 100\u00b0C. High-resolution structures of the designed proteins CA01 and DA05R1 were solved by x-ray crystallography (2.2 angstrom resolution) and nuclear magnetic resonance, respectively, and there was excellent agreement with the design models. This method provides a new strategy to rapidly create large numbers of diverse and designable protein scaffolds.",

        "abstract":"The previous design of an unprecedented family of two-, three-, and four-helical, right-handed coiled coils utilized nonbiological amino acids to efficiently pack spaces in the oligomer cores. Here we show that a stable, right-handed parallel tetrameric coiled coil, called RH4B, can be designed entirely using biological amino acids. The X-ray crystal structure of RH4B was determined to 1.1 Angstrom resolution using a designed metal binding site to coordinate a single Yb(2+) ion per 33-amino acid polypeptide chain. The resulting experimental phases were particularly accurate, and the experimental electron density map provided an especially clear, unbiased view of the molecule. The RH4B structure closely matched the design, with equivalent core rotamers and an overall root-mean-square deviation for the N-terminal repeat of the tetramer of 0.24 Angstrom. The clarity and resolution of the electron density map, however, revealed alternate rotamers and structural differences between the three sequence repeats in the molecule. These results suggest that the RH4B structure populates an unanticipated variety of structures.",

        "abstract":"We present a structural and functional analysis of the evolutionary optimization of a non-biological protein derived from a library of random amino acid sequences. A series of previously described in vitro selection experiments transformed a low-affinity ancestral sequence into a stably folded, high affinity ATP binding protein structure. While the evolutionarily optimized protein differs from its ancestral sequence through the accumulation of 12 amino acid mutations, the means by which those mutations enhance the stability and functionality of the protein were not well understood. We used a combination of mutagenesis, biochemistry, and NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structural and functional significance of each mutation. We solved the three-dimensional structure of the folding optimized protein by solution NMR, which revealed a fourth strand of the beta-sheet of the alpha\/beta-fold that was not observed in an earlier crystallographic analysis of a less stable version of the protein. The structural rigidity of the newly identified beta-strand was confirmed by T1, T2, and heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) measurements. Biochemical experiments were used to examine point mutations that revert the optimized protein back to the ancestral residue at each of the 12 sites. A combination of structural and functional data was then used to interpret the significance of each amino acid mutation. The enhanced ATP affinity was largely due to the emergence of a patch of positive charge density on the protein surface, while the increased solubility resulted from several mutations that increased the hydrophilicity of the protein surface, thereby decreasing protein aggregation. One mutation may stabilize the hydrophobic face of the beta-sheet.",

        "abstract":"Full-consensus designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), in which randomized positions of the previously described DARPin library have been fixed, are characterized. They show exceptionally high thermodynamic stabilities, even when compared to members of consensus DARPin libraries and even more so when compared to naturally occurring ankyrin repeat proteins. We determined the crystal structure of a full-consensus DARPin, containing an N-capping repeat, three identical internal repeats and a C-capping repeat at 2.05 A resolution, and compared its structure with that of the related DARPin library members E3_5 and E3_19. This structural comparison suggests that primarily salt bridges on the surface, which arrange in a network with almost crystal-like regularity, increase thermostability in the full-consensus NI(3)C DARPin to make it resistant to boiling. In the crystal structure, three sulfate ions complement this network. Thermal denaturation experiments in guanidine hydrochloride directly indicate a contribution of sulfate binding to the stability, providing further evidence for the stabilizing effect of surface-exposed electrostatic interactions and regular charge networks. The charged residues at the place of randomized residues in the DARPin libraries were selected based on sequence statistics and suggested that the charge interaction network is a hidden design feature of this protein family. Ankyrins can therefore use design principles from proteins of thermophilic organisms and reach at least similar stabilities.",

        "abstract":"The understanding of how primordial proteins emerged has been a fundamental and longstanding issue in biology and biochemistry. For a better understanding of primordial protein evolution, we synthesized an artificial protein on the basis of an evolutionary hypothesis, segment-based elongation starting from an autonomously foldable short peptide. A 10-residue protein, chignolin, the smallest foldable polypeptide ever reported, was used as a structural support to facilitate higher structural organization and gain-of-function in the development of an artificial protein. Repetitive cycles of segment elongation and subsequent phage display selection successfully produced a 25-residue protein, termed AF.2A1, with nanomolar affinity against the Fc region of immunoglobulin G. AF.2A1 shows exquisite molecular recognition ability such that it can distinguish conformational differences of the same molecule. The structure determined by NMR measurements demonstrated that AF.2A1 forms a globular protein-like conformation with the chignolin-derived \u03b2-hairpin and a tryptophan-mediated hydrophobic core. Using sequence analysis and a mutation study, we discovered that the structural organization and gain-of-function emerged from the vicinity of the chignolin segment, revealing that the structural support served as the core in both structural and functional development. Here, we propose an evolutionary model for primordial proteins in which a foldable segment serves as the evolving core to facilitate structural and functional evolution. This study provides insights into primordial protein evolution and also presents a novel methodology for designing small sized proteins useful for industrial and pharmaceutical applications.",

        "abstract":"The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif is a protein-protein interaction module that acts as an organizing centre for complexes regulating a multitude of biological processes. Despite accumulating evidence for the formation of TPR oligomers as an additional level of regulation there is a lack of structural and solution data explaining TPR self-association. In the present work we characterize the trimeric TPR-containing protein YbgF, which is linked to the Tol system in Gram-negative bacteria. By subtracting previously identified TPR consensus residues required for stability of the fold from residues conserved across YbgF homologs, we identified residues involved in oligomerization of the C-terminal YbgF TPR domain. Crafting these residues, which are located in loop regions between TPR motifs, onto the monomeric consensus TPR protein CTPR3 induced the formation of oligomers. The crystal structure of this engineered oligomer shows an asymmetric trimer where stacking interactions between the introduced tyrosines and displacement of the C-terminal hydrophilic capping helix, present in most TPR domains, are key to oligomerization. Asymmetric trimerization of the YbgF TPR domain and CTPR3Y3 leads to the formation of higher order oligomers both in the crystal and in solution. However, such open-ended self-association does not occur in full-length YbgF suggesting that the protein's N-terminal coiled-coil domain restricts further oligomerization. This interpretation is borne out in experiments where the coiled-coil domain of YbgF was engineered onto the N-terminus of CTPR3Y3 and shown to block self-association beyond trimerization. Our study lays the foundations for understanding the structural basis for TPR domain self-association and how such self-association can be regulated in TPR domain-containing proteins.",

        "abstract":"Over the past two decades, designed metallopeptides have held the promise for understanding a variety of fundamental questions in metallobiochemistry; however, these dreams have not yet been realized because of a lack of structural data to elaborate the protein scaffolds before metal complexation and the resultant metalated structures which ultimately exist. This is because there are few reports of structural characterization of such systems either in their metalated or nonmetalated forms and no examples where an apo structure and the corresponding metalated peptide assembly have both been defined by X-ray crystallography. Herein we present X-ray structures of two de novo designed parallel three-stranded coiled coils (designed using the heptad repeat (a \u2192 g)) CSL9C (CS = Coil Ser) and CSL19C in their nonmetalated forms, determined to 1.36 and 2.15 A resolutions, respectively. Leucines from either position 9 (a site) or 19 (d site) are replaced by cysteine to generate the constructs CSL9C and CSL19C, respectively, yielding thiol-rich pockets at the hydrophobic interior of these peptides, suitable to bind heavy metals such as As(III), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). We use these structures to understand the inherent structural differences between a and d sites to clarify the basis of the observed differential spectroscopic behavior of metal binding in these types of peptides. Cys side chains of (CSL9C)(3) show alternate conformations and are partially preorganized for metal binding, whereas cysteines in (CSL19C)(3) are present as a single conformer. Zn(II) ions, which do not coordinate or influence Cys residues at the designed metal sites but are essential for forming X-ray quality crystals, are bound to His and Glu residues at the crystal packing interfaces of both structures. These \"apo\" structures are used to clarify the changes in metal site organization between metalated As(CSL9C)(3) and to speculate on the differential basis of Hg(II) binding in a versus d peptides. Thus, for the first time, one can establish general rules for heavy metal binding to Cys-rich sites in designed proteins which may provide insight for understanding how heavy metals bind to metallochaperones or metalloregulatory proteins.",

Several point mutations had been introduced to optimize the C-cap and were shown to indeed further increase the stability of DARPins.

An NI(3)C C-cap mutant carrying five additional mutations in the interface to the preceding repeat, previously designed by using the consensus sequence as a guide, showed a rigid-body movement of the C-cap towards the internal repeat. This movement results in an increased buried surface area and a superior surface complementarity and explains the improved stability in equilibrium unfolding, compared to the original C-cap. A C-cap mutant with three additional mutations introducing suitably spaced charged residues did not show formation of salt bridges, explaining why its stability was not increased further.

        "abstract":"Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) that specifically bind to almost any target can be obtained by ribosome display or phage display from combinatorial libraries. Although DARPins are already very stable molecules, molecular dynamics simulations, equilibrium denaturation experiments, structural studies, and recent NMR experiments suggested that the unfolding of the original C-terminal capping repeat (C-cap), taken from a natural ankyrin repeat protein, limits the stability of the initial DARPin design. Several point mutations had been introduced to optimize the C-cap and were shown to indeed further increase the stability of DARPins. We now determined crystal structures of DARPins with one or three full-consensus internal repeats (NI(1)C or NI(3)C) between an N-terminal capping repeat and mutants of the C-cap. An NI(1)C mutant, in which the C-cap was only extended by three additional helix-forming residues, showed no structural change but reduced B-factors in the C-cap. An NI(3)C C-cap mutant carrying five additional mutations in the interface to the preceding repeat, previously designed by using the consensus sequence as a guide, showed a rigid-body movement of the C-cap towards the internal repeat. This movement results in an increased buried surface area and a superior surface complementarity and explains the improved stability in equilibrium unfolding, compared to the original C-cap. A C-cap mutant with three additional mutations introducing suitably spaced charged residues did not show formation of salt bridges, explaining why its stability was not increased further. These structural studies underline the importance of repeat coupling for stability and help in the further design of this protein family.",

Equivalent solutions of the centrosymmetric bilayers were determined by two direct phasing programs in space groups P1 and P1bar. The unit cell contains two L-alpha-helices and two D-alpha-helices. The columnar-sheet bilayer motif seen in L-Alpha-1 is maintained in the D,L-Alpha-1 structure except that each sheet of head-to-tail helices is composed of one enantiomer and is related to its neighboring sheets by inversion symmetry. Comparison to the L-Alpha-1 structure provides further insight into peptide design. The high resolution and small asymmetric unit allowed building an intricate model (R = 13.1%, Rfree = 14.5%) that incorporates much of the discrete disorder of peptide and solvent. Ethanolamine and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) molecules bind near helix termini. Rigid body analysis identifies sites of restricted displacements and torsions. Side-chain discrete disorder propagates into the backbone of one helix but not the other. Although no side chain in Alpha-1 is rigid, the environments in the crystal restrict some of them to no or only one active torsion.",

        "abstract":"Lipopeptide detergents (LPDs) are a new class of amphiphile designed specifically for the structural study of integral membrane proteins. The LPD monomer consists of a 25-residue peptide with fatty acyl chains linked to side chains located at positions 2 and 24 of the peptide. LPDs are designed to form alpha-helices that self-assemble into cylindrical micelles, providing a more natural interior acyl chain packing environment relative to traditional detergents. We have determined the crystal structure of LPD-12, an LPD coupled to two dodecanoic acids, to a resolution of 1.20 A. The LPD-12 monomers adopt the target conformation and associate into cylindrical octamers as expected. Pairs of helices are strongly associated as Alacoil-type antiparallel dimers, and four of these dimers interact through much looser contacts into assemblies with approximate D(2) symmetry. The aligned helices form a cylindrical shell with a hydrophilic exterior that protects an interior hydrophobic cavity containing the 16 LPD acyl chains. Over 90% of the methylene\/methyl groups from the acylated side chains are visible in the micelle interiors, and approximately 90% of these adopt trans dihedral angle conformations. Dodecylmaltoside (DDM) was required for the crystallization of LPD-12, and we find 10-24 ordered DDM molecules associated with each LPD assembly, resulting in an overall micelle molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa. The structures confirm the major design objectives of the LPD framework, and reveal unexpected features that will be helpful in the engineering additional versions of lipopeptide amphiphiles.",

        "abstract":"Numerous instances can be seen in evolution in which protein quaternary structures have diverged while the sequences of the building blocks have remained fairly conserved. However, the path through which such divergence has taken place is usually not known. We have designed two synthetic 29-residue \u03b1-helical peptides, based on the coiled-coil structural motif, that spontaneously self-assemble into helical nanotubes in vitro. Using electron cryomicroscopy with a newly available direct electron detection capability, we can achieve near-atomic resolution of these thin structures. We show how conservative changes of only one or two amino acids result in dramatic changes in quaternary structure, in which the assemblies can be switched between two very different forms. This system provides a framework for understanding how small sequence changes in evolution can translate into very large changes in supramolecular structure, a phenomenon that may have significant implications for the de novo design of synthetic peptide assemblies.",

        "abstract":"Over the past two decades, designed metallopeptides have held the promise for understanding a variety of fundamental questions in metallobiochemistry; however, these dreams have not yet been realized because of a lack of structural data to elaborate the protein scaffolds before metal complexation and the resultant metalated structures which ultimately exist. This is because there are few reports of structural characterization of such systems either in their metalated or nonmetalated forms and no examples where an apo structure and the corresponding metalated peptide assembly have both been defined by X-ray crystallography. Herein we present X-ray structures of two de novo designed parallel three-stranded coiled coils (designed using the heptad repeat (a \u2192 g)) CSL9C (CS = Coil Ser) and CSL19C in their nonmetalated forms, determined to 1.36 and 2.15 A resolutions, respectively. Leucines from either position 9 (a site) or 19 (d site) are replaced by cysteine to generate the constructs CSL9C and CSL19C, respectively, yielding thiol-rich pockets at the hydrophobic interior of these peptides, suitable to bind heavy metals such as As(III), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). We use these structures to understand the inherent structural differences between a and d sites to clarify the basis of the observed differential spectroscopic behavior of metal binding in these types of peptides. Cys side chains of (CSL9C)(3) show alternate conformations and are partially preorganized for metal binding, whereas cysteines in (CSL19C)(3) are present as a single conformer. Zn(II) ions, which do not coordinate or influence Cys residues at the designed metal sites but are essential for forming X-ray quality crystals, are bound to His and Glu residues at the crystal packing interfaces of both structures. These \"apo\" structures are used to clarify the changes in metal site organization between metalated As(CSL9C)(3) and to speculate on the differential basis of Hg(II) binding in a versus d peptides. Thus, for the first time, one can establish general rules for heavy metal binding to Cys-rich sites in designed proteins which may provide insight for understanding how heavy metals bind to metallochaperones or metalloregulatory proteins.",

        "abstract":"This paper describes the X-ray crystallographic structure of a designed cyclic beta-sheet peptide that forms a well-defined hydrogen-bonded dimer that mimics beta-sheet dimers formed by proteins. The 54-membered ring macrocyclic peptide (1a) contains molecular template and turn units that induce beta-sheet structure in a heptapeptide strand that forms the dimerization interface. The X-ray crystallographic structure reveals the structures of the two \"Hao\" amino acids that help template the beta-sheet structure and the two delta-linked ornithine turn units that link the Hao-containing template to the heptapeptide beta-strand. The Hao amino acids adopt a conformation that resembles a tripeptide in a beta-strand conformation, with one edge of the Hao unit presenting an alternating array of hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor groups in the same pattern as that of a tripeptide beta-strand. The delta-linked ornithines adopt a conformation that resembles a hydrogen-bonded beta-turn, in which the ornithine takes the place of the i+1 and i+2 residues. The dimers formed by macrocyclic beta-sheet 1a resemble the dimers of many proteins, such as defensin HNP-3, the lambda-Cro repressor, interleukin 8, and the ribonuclease H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The dimers of 1a self-assemble in the solid state into a barrel-shaped trimer of dimers in which the three dimers are arranged in a triangular fashion. Molecular modeling in which one of the three dimers is removed and the remaining two dimers are aligned face-to-face provides a model of the dimers of dimers of closely related macrocyclic beta-sheet peptides that were observed in solution.",

To aid in this effort, we present atomic structures of fiber-forming segments of proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease in complex with small molecule binders, determined by X-ray microcrystallography. The fiber-like complexes consist of pairs of \u03b2-sheets, with small molecules binding between the sheets, roughly parallel to the fiber axis. The structures suggest that apolar molecules drift along the fiber, consistent with the observation of nonspecific binding to a variety of amyloid proteins. In contrast, negatively charged orange-G binds specifically to lysine side chains of adjacent sheets. These structures provide molecular frameworks for the design of diagnostics and drugs for protein aggregation diseases.",

A\u03b2 molecules form \u03b2-sheet containing structures that assemble into a variety of polymorphic oligomers, protofibers, and fibers that exhibit a range of lifetimes and cellular toxicities. This polymorphic nature of A\u03b2 has frustrated its biophysical characterization, its structural determination, and our understanding of its pathological mechanism. To elucidate A\u03b2 polymorphism in atomic detail, we determined eight new microcrystal structures of fiber-forming segments of A\u03b2. These structures, all of short, self-complementing pairs of \u03b2-sheets termed steric zippers, reveal a variety of modes of self-association of A\u03b2. Combining these atomic structures with previous NMR studies allows us to propose several fiber models, offering molecular models for some of the repertoire of polydisperse structures accessible to A\u03b2. These structures and molecular models contribute fundamental information for understanding A\u03b2 polymorphic nature and pathogenesis.",

Before the emergence of biosynthetic pathways, this set is the most plausible resource for protein formation (i.e., proteogenesis) within the overall process of abiogenesis. An essential unsolved question regarding this prebiotic set is whether it defines a \"foldable set\"--that is, does it contain sufficient chemical information to permit cooperatively folding polypeptides? If so, what (if any) characteristic properties might such polypeptides exhibit? To investigate these questions, two \"primitive\" versions of an extant protein fold (the \u03b2-trefoil) were produced by top-down symmetric deconstruction, resulting in a reduced alphabet size of 12 or 13 amino acids and a percentage of prebiotic amino acids approaching 80%. These proteins show a substantial acidification of pI and require high salt concentrations for cooperative folding. The results suggest that the prebiotic amino acids do comprise a foldable set within the halophile environment.",

        "abstract":"Nature presents various protein fibers that bridge the nanometer to micrometer regimes. These structures provide inspiration for the de novo design of biomimetic assemblies, both to address difficulties in studying and understanding natural systems, and to provide routes to new biomaterials with potential applications in nanotechnology and medicine. We have designed a self-assembling fiber system, the SAFs, in which two small \u03b1-helical peptides are programmed to form a dimeric coiled coil and assemble in a controlled manner. The resulting fibers are tens of nm wide and tens of \u03bcm long, and, therefore, comprise millions of peptides to give gigadalton supramolecular structures. Here, we describe the structure of the SAFs determined to approximately 8\u00a0\u00c5 resolution using cryotransmission electron microscopy. Individual micrographs show clear ultrastructure that allowed direct interpretation of the packing of individual \u03b1-helices within the fibers, and the construction of a 3D electron density map. Furthermore, a model was derived using the cryotransmission electron microscopy data and side chains taken from a 2.3\u00a0\u00c5 X-ray crystal structure of a peptide building block incapable of forming fibers. This was validated using single-particle analysis techniques, and was stable in prolonged molecular-dynamics simulation, confirming its structural viability. The level of self-assembly and self-organization in the SAFs is unprecedented for a designed peptide-based material, particularly for a system of considerably reduced complexity compared with natural proteins. This structural insight is a unique high-resolution description of how \u03b1-helical fibrils pack into larger protein fibers, and provides a basis for the design and engineering of future biomaterials.",

        "abstract":"There is a general need for the engineering of protein-like molecules that organize into geometrically specific superstructures on molecular surfaces, directing further functionalization to create richly textured, multilayered assemblies. Here we describe a computational approach whereby the surface properties and symmetry of a targeted surface define the sequence and superstructure of surface-organizing peptides. Computational design proceeds in a series of steps that encode both surface recognition and favorable intersubunit packing interactions. This procedure is exemplified in the design of peptides that assemble into a tubular structure surrounding single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). The geometrically defined, virus-like coating created by these peptides converts the smooth surfaces of SWNTs into highly textured assemblies with long-scale order, capable of directing the assembly of gold nanoparticles into helical arrays along the SWNT axis.",

        "abstract":"The collagen triple helix is the most abundant protein fold in humans. Despite its deceptively simple structure, very little is understood about its folding and fibrillization energy landscape. In this work, using a combination of x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we carry out a detailed study of stabilizing pair-wise interactions between the positively charged lysine and the negatively charged amino acids aspartate and glutamate. We find important differences in the side chain conformation of amino acids in the crystalline and solution state. Structures from x-ray crystallography may have similarities to the densely packed triple helices of collagen fibers whereas solution NMR structures reveal the simpler interactions of isolated triple helices. In solution, two distinct types of contacts are observed: axial and lateral. Such register-specific interactions are crucial for the understanding of the registration process of collagens and the overall stability of proteins in this family. However, in the crystalline state, there is a significant rearrangement of the side chain conformation allowing for packing interactions between adjacent helices, which suggests that charged amino acids may play a dual role in collagen stabilization and folding, first at the level of triple helical assembly and second during fibril formation.",

        "abstract":"Noncanonical amino acids have proved extremely useful for modifying the properties of proteins. Among them, extensively fluorinated (fluorous) amino acids seem particularly effective in increasing protein stability; however, in the absence of structural data, the basis of this stabilizing effect remains poorly understood. To address this problem, we solved X-ray structures for three small proteins with hydrophobic cores that are packed with either fluorocarbon or hydrocarbon side chains and compared their stabilities. Although larger, the fluorinated residues are accommodated within the protein with minimal structural perturbation, because they closely match the shape of the hydrocarbon side chains that they replace. Thus, stability increases seem to be better explained by increases in buried hydrophobic surface area that accompany fluorination than by specific fluorous interactions between fluorinated side chains. This finding is illustrated by the design of a highly fluorinated protein that, by compensating for the larger volume and surface area of the fluorinated side chains, exhibits similar stability to its nonfluorinated counterpart. These structure-based observations should inform efforts to rationally modulate protein function using noncanonical amino acids.",

        "abstract":"The collagen triple helix is the most abundant protein fold in humans. Despite its deceptively simple structure, very little is understood about its folding and fibrillization energy landscape. In this work, using a combination of x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we carry out a detailed study of stabilizing pair-wise interactions between the positively charged lysine and the negatively charged amino acids aspartate and glutamate. We find important differences in the side chain conformation of amino acids in the crystalline and solution state. Structures from x-ray crystallography may have similarities to the densely packed triple helices of collagen fibers whereas solution NMR structures reveal the simpler interactions of isolated triple helices. In solution, two distinct types of contacts are observed: axial and lateral. Such register-specific interactions are crucial for the understanding of the registration process of collagens and the overall stability of proteins in this family. However, in the crystalline state, there is a significant rearrangement of the side chain conformation allowing for packing interactions between adjacent helices, which suggests that charged amino acids may play a dual role in collagen stabilization and folding, first at the level of triple helical assembly and second during fibril formation.",

        "abstract":"To probe the potential for activity in unevolved amino acid sequence space, we created a third generation combinatorial library of de novo four-helix bundle proteins. The \"artificial superfamily\" of helical bundles was designed using binary patterning of polar and nonpolar residues, and expressed in Escherichia coli from a library of synthetic genes. WA20, picked from the library, is one of the most stable proteins in the superfamily, and has rudimentary activities such as esterase and lipase. Here we report the crystal structure of WA20, determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method. Unexpectedly, the WA20 crystal structure is not a monomeric four-helix bundle, but a dimeric four-helix bundle. Each monomer comprises two long \u03b1-helices that intertwist with the helices of the other monomer. The two monomers together form a 3D domain-swapped four-helix bundle dimer. In addition, there are two hydrophobic pockets, which may potentially provide substrate binding sites. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that the molecular weight of WA20 is ~25 kDa and the shape is rod-like (the maximum length, D(max) = ~8 nm), indicating that WA20 forms a dimeric four-helix bundle in solution. These results demonstrate that our de novo protein library contains not only simple monomeric proteins, but also stable and functional multimeric proteins.",

        "abstract":"A challenge in the computational design of enzymes is that multiple properties, including substrate binding, transition state stabilization and product release, must be simultaneously optimized, and this has limited the absolute activity of successful designs. Here, we focus on a single critical property of many enzymes: the nucleophilicity of an active site residue that initiates catalysis. We design proteins with idealized serine-containing catalytic triads and assess their nucleophilicity directly in native biological systems using activity-based organophosphate probes. Crystal structures of the most successful designs show unprecedented agreement with computational models, including extensive hydrogen bonding networks between the catalytic triad (or quartet) residues, and mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that these networks are critical for serine activation and organophosphate reactivity. Following optimization by yeast display, the designs react with organophosphate probes at rates comparable to natural serine hydrolases. Co-crystal structures with diisopropyl fluorophosphate bound to the serine nucleophile suggest that the designs could provide the basis for a new class of organophosphate capture agents.",

        "abstract":"Protein crystals have catalytic and materials applications and are central to efforts in structural biology and therapeutic development. Designing predetermined crystal structures can be subtle given the complexity of proteins and the noncovalent interactions that govern crystallization. De novo protein design provides an approach to engineer highly complex nanoscale molecular structures, and often the positions of atoms can be programmed with sub-\u00c5 precision. Herein, a computational approach is presented for the design of proteins that self-assemble in three dimensions to yield macroscopic crystals. A three-helix coiled-coil protein is designed de novo to form a polar, layered, three-dimensional crystal having the P6 space group, which has a \"honeycomb-like\" structure and hexameric channels that span the crystal. The approach involves: (i) creating an ensemble of crystalline structures consistent with the targeted symmetry; (ii) characterizing this ensemble to identify \"designable\" structures from minima in the sequence-structure energy landscape and designing sequences for these structures; (iii) experimentally characterizing candidate proteins. A 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure of one such designed protein exhibits sub-\u00c5 agreement [backbone root mean square deviation (rmsd)] with the computational model of the crystal. This approach to crystal design has potential applications to the de novo design of nanostructured materials and to the modification of natural proteins to facilitate X-ray crystallographic analysis.",

POG3-PRG-POG4 was designed to permit investigation of the side-chain conformation of the Arg residues in a triple-helical structure. Because of the alternative structure of one of three Arg residues, four side-chain conformations were observed in an asymmetric unit. Among them, three adopt a ttg(-) t conformation and the other adopts a tg(-) g(-) t conformation. A statistical analysis of 80 Arg residues in various triple-helical peptides showed that, unlike those in globular proteins, they preferentially adopt a tt conformation for \u03c71 and \u03c72 , as observed in POG3-PRG-POG4. This conformation permits van der Waals contacts between the side-chain atoms of Arg and the main-chain atoms of the adjacent strand in the same molecule. Unlike many other host-guest peptides, in which there is a significant difference between the helical twists in the guest and the host peptides, POG3-PRG-POG4 shows a marked difference between the helical twists in the N-terminal peptide and those in the C-terminal peptide, separated near the Arg residue. This suggested that the unique side-chain conformation of the Arg residue affects not only the conformation of the guest peptide, but also the conformation of the peptide away from the Arg residue.",

        "abstract":"Protein crystals have catalytic and materials applications and are central to efforts in structural biology and therapeutic development. Designing predetermined crystal structures can be subtle given the complexity of proteins and the noncovalent interactions that govern crystallization. De novo protein design provides an approach to engineer highly complex nanoscale molecular structures, and often the positions of atoms can be programmed with sub-\u00c5 precision. Herein, a computational approach is presented for the design of proteins that self-assemble in three dimensions to yield macroscopic crystals. A three-helix coiled-coil protein is designed de novo to form a polar, layered, three-dimensional crystal having the P6 space group, which has a \"honeycomb-like\" structure and hexameric channels that span the crystal. The approach involves: (i) creating an ensemble of crystalline structures consistent with the targeted symmetry; (ii) characterizing this ensemble to identify \"designable\" structures from minima in the sequence-structure energy landscape and designing sequences for these structures; (iii) experimentally characterizing candidate proteins. A 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure of one such designed protein exhibits sub-\u00c5 agreement [backbone root mean square deviation (rmsd)] with the computational model of the crystal. This approach to crystal design has potential applications to the de novo design of nanostructured materials and to the modification of natural proteins to facilitate X-ray crystallographic analysis.",

Armadillo repeat proteins (ArmRPs) are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions, and because of their modular recognition of extended peptide regions they can serve as templates for the design of artificial peptide binding scaffolds. On the basis of sequential and structural analyses, different consensus-designed ArmRPs were synthesized and show high thermodynamic stabilities, compared to naturally occurring ArmRPs. We determined the crystal structures of four full-consensus ArmRPs with three or four identical internal repeats and two different designs for the N- and C-caps. The crystal structures were refined at resolutions ranging from 1.80 to 2.50 \u00c5 for the above mentioned designs. A redesign of our initial caps was required to obtain well diffracting crystals. However, the structures with the redesigned caps caused domain swapping events between the N-caps. To prevent this domain swap, 9 and 6 point mutations were introduced in the N- and C-caps, respectively. Structural and biophysical analysis showed that this subsequent redesign of the N-cap prevented domain swapping and improved the thermodynamic stability of the proteins. We systematically investigated the best cap combinations. We conclude that designed ArmRPs with optimized caps are intrinsically stable and well-expressed monomeric proteins and that the high-resolution structures provide excellent structural templates for the continuation of the design of sequence-specific modular peptide recognition units based on armadillo repeats.",

To prevent this domain swap, 9 and 6 point mutations were introduced in the N- and C-caps, respectively. Structural and biophysical analysis showed that this subsequent redesign of the N-cap prevented domain swapping and improved the thermodynamic stability of the proteins. We systematically investigated the best cap combinations. We conclude that designed ArmRPs with optimized caps are intrinsically stable and well-expressed monomeric proteins and that the high-resolution structures provide excellent structural templates for the continuation of the design of sequence-specific modular peptide recognition units based on armadillo repeats.",

        "abstract":"A challenge in the computational design of enzymes is that multiple properties, including substrate binding, transition state stabilization and product release, must be simultaneously optimized, and this has limited the absolute activity of successful designs. Here, we focus on a single critical property of many enzymes: the nucleophilicity of an active site residue that initiates catalysis. We design proteins with idealized serine-containing catalytic triads and assess their nucleophilicity directly in native biological systems using activity-based organophosphate probes. Crystal structures of the most successful designs show unprecedented agreement with computational models, including extensive hydrogen bonding networks between the catalytic triad (or quartet) residues, and mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that these networks are critical for serine activation and organophosphate reactivity. Following optimization by yeast display, the designs react with organophosphate probes at rates comparable to natural serine hydrolases. Co-crystal structures with diisopropyl fluorophosphate bound to the serine nucleophile suggest that the designs could provide the basis for a new class of organophosphate capture agents.",

        "abstract":"This paper describes the design, characterization, and metal-binding properties of a 32-residue polypeptide called AQ-C16C19. The sequence of this peptide is composed of four repeats of the seven residue sequence Ile-Ala-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gln-Lys but with a Cys-X-X-Cys metal-binding motif substituted at positions 16-19. Size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering detection (SEC-MALS) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy studies showed that the apo peptide exhibits a pH-dependent oligomerization state in which a three-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled coil is dominant between pH5.4 and 8.5. The Cd(2+)-binding properties of the AQ-C16C19 peptide were studied by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS), and (113)Cd NMR techniques. The holoprotein was found to contain a polynuclear cadmium-thiolate center formed within the hydrophobic core of the triple-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structure. The X-ray crystal structure of the Cd-loaded peptide, resolved at 1.85\u00c5 resolution, revealed an adamantane-like configuration of the polynuclear metal center consisting of four cadmium ions, six thiolate sulfur ligands from cysteine residues and four oxygen-donor ligands. Three of these are from glutamic acid residues and one is from an exogenous water molecule. Thus, each cadmium ion is coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral S(3)O geometry. The metal cluster was found to form cooperatively at pH5.4 but in a stepwise fashion at pH>7. The results demonstrate that synthetic coiled-coils can be designed to incorporate multinuclear metal clusters, a proof-of-concept for their potential use in developing synthetic metalloenzymes and multi-electron redox agents.",

Several major pathogens have resisted traditional vaccine development, although vulnerable epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies have been identified for several such cases. Hence, new vaccine design methods to induce epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies are needed. Here we show, with a neutralization epitope from respiratory syncytial virus, that computational protein design can generate small, thermally and conformationally stable protein scaffolds that accurately mimic the viral epitope structure and induce potent neutralizing antibodies. These scaffolds represent promising leads for the research and development of a human respiratory syncytial virus vaccine needed to protect infants, young children and the elderly. More generally, the results provide proof of principle for epitope-focused and scaffold-based vaccine design, and encourage the evaluation and further development of these strategies for a variety of other vaccine targets, including antigenically highly variable pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus and influenza.",

        "abstract":"A highly diverse DNA library coding for ankyrin seven-repeat proteins (ANK-N5C) was designed and constructed by a PCR-based combinatorial assembly strategy. A bacterial melibiose fermentation assay was adapted for in vivo functional screen. We isolated a transcription blocker that completely inhibits the melibiose-dependent expression of \u03b1-galactosidase (MelA) and melibiose permease (MelB) of Escherichia coli by specifically preventing activation of the melAB operon. High-resolution crystal structural determination reveals that the designed ANK-N5C protein has a typical ankyrin fold, and the specific transcription blocker, ANK-N5C-281, forms a domain-swapped dimer. Functional tests suggest that the activity of MelR, a DNA-binding transcription activator and a member of AraC family of transcription factors, is inhibited by ANK-N5C-281 protein. All ANK-N5C proteins are expected to have a concave binding area with negative surface potential, suggesting that the designed ANK-N5C library proteins may facilitate the discovery of binders recognizing structural motifs with positive surface potential, like in DNA-binding proteins. Overall, our results show that the established library is a useful tool for the discovery of novel bioactive reagents.",

Here, we report the design of a membrane-spanning, four-helical bundle that transports first-row transition metal ions Zn(2+) and Co(2+), but not Ca(2+), across membranes. The conduction path was designed to contain two di-metal binding sites that bind with negative cooperativity. X-ray crystallography and solid-state and solution nuclear magnetic resonance indicate that the overall helical bundle is formed from two tightly interacting pairs of helices, which form individual domains that interact weakly along a more dynamic interface. Vesicle flux experiments show that as Zn(2+) ions diffuse down their concentration gradients, protons are antiported. These experiments illustrate the feasibility of designing membrane proteins with predefined structural and dynamic properties.",

        "abstract":"A highly diverse DNA library coding for ankyrin seven-repeat proteins (ANK-N5C) was designed and constructed by a PCR-based combinatorial assembly strategy. A bacterial melibiose fermentation assay was adapted for in vivo functional screen. We isolated a transcription blocker that completely inhibits the melibiose-dependent expression of \u03b1-galactosidase (MelA) and melibiose permease (MelB) of Escherichia coli by specifically preventing activation of the melAB operon. High-resolution crystal structural determination reveals that the designed ANK-N5C protein has a typical ankyrin fold, and the specific transcription blocker, ANK-N5C-281, forms a domain-swapped dimer. Functional tests suggest that the activity of MelR, a DNA-binding transcription activator and a member of AraC family of transcription factors, is inhibited by ANK-N5C-281 protein. All ANK-N5C proteins are expected to have a concave binding area with negative surface potential, suggesting that the designed ANK-N5C library proteins may facilitate the discovery of binders recognizing structural motifs with positive surface potential, like in DNA-binding proteins. Overall, our results show that the established library is a useful tool for the discovery of novel bioactive reagents.",

        "abstract":"Consensus protein design is a rapid and reliable technique for the improvement of protein stability, which relies on the use of homologous protein sequences. To enhance the stability of a fibronectin type III (FN3) domain, consensus design was employed using an alignment of 2123 sequences. The resulting FN3 domain, FN3con, has unprecedented stability, with a melting temperature >100\u00b0C, a \u0394G(D-N) of 15.5 kcal mol(-1) and a greatly reduced unfolding rate compared with wild-type. To determine the underlying molecular basis for stability, an X-ray crystal structure of FN3con was determined to 2.0 \u00c5 and compared with other FN3 domains of varying stabilities. The structure of FN3con reveals significantly increased salt bridge interactions that are cooperatively networked, and a highly optimized hydrophobic core. Molecular dynamics simulations of FN3con and comparison structures show the cooperative power of electrostatic and hydrophobic networks in improving FN3con stability. Taken together, our data reveal that FN3con stability does not result from a single mechanism, but rather the combination of several features and the removal of non-conserved, unfavorable interactions. The large number of sequences employed in this study has most likely enhanced the robustness of the consensus design, which is now possible due to the increased sequence availability in the post-genomic era. These studies increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern stability and demonstrate the rising potential for enhancing stability via the consensus method.",

The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and recombination of simple building blocks. The overall architecture of tandem repeat protein structures--which is dictated by the internal geometry and local packing of the repeat building blocks--is highly diverse, ranging from extended, super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners, to closed and compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding and catalysis. Here we report the development and validation of computational methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied these methods to design a series of closed \u03b1-solenoid repeat structures (\u03b1-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering, our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature.

        "abstract":"Tandem repeat proteins, which are formed by repetition of modular units of protein sequence and structure, play important biological roles as macromolecular binding and scaffolding domains, enzymes, and building blocks for the assembly of fibrous materials. The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and recombination of simple building blocks. The overall architecture of tandem repeat protein structures--which is dictated by the internal geometry and local packing of the repeat building blocks--is highly diverse, ranging from extended, super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners, to closed and compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding and catalysis. Here we report the development and validation of computational methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied these methods to design a series of closed \u03b1-solenoid repeat structures (\u03b1-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering, our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an example, we have successfully designed and validated closed \u03b1-solenoid repeats with a left-handed helical architecture that--to our knowledge--is not yet present in the protein structure database.",

        "abstract":"Community Structure-Activity Resource (CSAR) conducted a benchmark exercise to evaluate the current computational methods for protein design, ligand docking, and scoring\/ranking. The exercise consisted of three phases. The first phase required the participants to identify and rank order which designed sequences were able to bind the small molecule digoxigenin. The second phase challenged the community to select a near-native pose of digoxigenin from a set of decoy poses for two of the designed proteins. The third phase investigated the ability of current methods to rank\/score the binding affinity of 10 related steroids to one of the designed proteins (pKd = 4.1 to 6.7). We found that 11 of 13 groups were able to correctly select the sequence that bound digoxigenin, with most groups providing the correct three-dimensional structure for the backbone of the protein as well as all atoms of the active-site residues. Eleven of the 14 groups were able to select the appropriate pose from a set of plausible decoy poses. The ability to predict absolute binding affinities is still a difficult task, as 8 of 14 groups were able to correlate scores to affinity (Pearson-r > 0.7) of the designed protein for congeneric steroids and only 5 of 14 groups were able to correlate the ranks of the 10 related ligands (Spearman-\u03c1 > 0.7).",

Here we describe the computational design of four-fold symmetrical (\u03b2\/\u03b1)8 barrels guided by geometrical and chemical principles. Experimental characterization of 33 designs revealed the importance of side chain-backbone hydrogen bonds for defining the strand register between repeat units. The X-ray crystal structure of a designed thermostable 184-residue protein is nearly identical to that of the designed TIM-barrel model. PSI-BLAST searches do not identify sequence similarities to known TIM-barrel proteins, and sensitive profile-profile searches indicate that the design sequence is distant from other naturally occurring TIM-barrel superfamilies, suggesting that Nature has sampled only a subset of the sequence space available to the TIM-barrel fold. The ability to design TIM barrels de novo opens new possibilities for custom-made enzymes.",

The long, often flexible loops that form such cavities in many natural proteins are difficult to precisely program and thus challenging for computational protein design. Here we describe an alternative approach to this problem. We fused two stable proteins with C2 symmetry-a de novo designed dimeric ferredoxin fold and a de novo designed TIM barrel-such that their symmetry axes are aligned to create scaffolds with large cavities that can serve as binding pockets or enzymatic reaction chambers. The crystal structures of two such designs confirm the presence of a 420 cubic \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m chamber defined by the top of the designed TIM barrel and the bottom of the ferredoxin dimer. We functionalized the scaffold by installing a metal-binding site consisting of four glutamate residues close to the symmetry axis. The protein binds lanthanide ions with very high affinity as demonstrated by tryptophan-enhanced terbium luminescence. This approach can be extended to other metals and cofactors, making this scaffold a modular platform for the design of binding proteins and biocatalysts.",

        "abstract":"Tandem repeat proteins, which are formed by repetition of modular units of protein sequence and structure, play important biological roles as macromolecular binding and scaffolding domains, enzymes, and building blocks for the assembly of fibrous materials. The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and recombination of simple building blocks. The overall architecture of tandem repeat protein structures--which is dictated by the internal geometry and local packing of the repeat building blocks--is highly diverse, ranging from extended, super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners, to closed and compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding and catalysis. Here we report the development and validation of computational methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied these methods to design a series of closed \u03b1-solenoid repeat structures (\u03b1-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering, our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an example, we have successfully designed and validated closed \u03b1-solenoid repeats with a left-handed helical architecture that--to our knowledge--is not yet present in the protein structure database.",

        "abstract":"We have engineered a metal-binding site into the novel artificial \u03b2-propeller protein Pizza. This new Pizza variant carries two nearly identical domains per polypeptide chain, and forms a trimer with three-fold symmetry. The designed single metal ion binding site lies on the symmetry axis, bonding the trimer together. Two copies of the trimer associate in the presence of cadmium chloride in solution, and very high-resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals a nanocrystal of cadmium chloride, sandwiched between two trimers of the protein. This nanocrystal, containing seven cadmium ions lying in a plane and twelve interspersed chloride ions, is the smallest reported to date. Our results indicate the feasibility of using rationally designed symmetrical proteins to biomineralize nanocrystals with useful properties.",

        "abstract":"Protein conformational switches have many useful applications but are difficult to design rationally. Here we demonstrate how the isoenergetic energy landscape of higher-order coiled coils can enable the formation of an oligomerization switch by insertion of a single destabilizing element into an otherwise stable computationally designed scaffold. We describe a de novo designed peptide that was discovered to switch between a parallel symmetric pentamer at pH 8 and a trimer of antiparallel dimers at pH 6. The transition between pentamer and hexamer is caused by changes in the protonation states of glutamatic acid residues with highly upshifted pKa values in both oligomer forms. The drastic conformational change coupled with the narrow pH range makes the peptide sequence an attractive candidate for introduction of pH sensing into other proteins. The results highlight the remarkable ability of simple-\u03b1 helices to self-assemble into a vast range of structural states.",

        "abstract":"The self-assembly of peptides and proteins into higher-ordered structures is encoded in the amino acid sequence of each peptide or protein. Understanding the relationship among the amino acid sequence, the assembly dynamics, and the structure of well-defined peptide oligomers expands the synthetic toolbox for these structures. Here, we present the X-ray crystallographic structure and solution behavior of de novo peptides that form antiparallel coiled-coil hexamers (ACC-Hex) by an interaction motif neither found in nature nor predicted by existing peptide design software. The 1.70 \u00c5 X-ray crystallographic structure of peptide 1a shows six \u03b1-helices associating in an antiparallel arrangement around a central axis comprising hydrophobic and aromatic residues. Size-exclusion chromatography studies suggest that peptides 1 form stable oligomers in solution, and circular dichroism experiments show that peptides 1 are stable to relatively high temperatures. Small-angle X-ray scattering studies of the solution behavior of peptide 1a indicate an equilibrium of dimers, hexamers, and larger aggregates in solution. The structures presented here represent a new motif of biomolecular self-assembly not previously observed for de novo peptides and suggest supramolecular design principles for material scaffolds based on coiled-coil motifs containing aromatic residues.",

        "abstract":"Learning to engineer self-assembly would enable the precise organization of molecules by design to create matter with tailored properties. Here we demonstrate that proteins can direct the self-assembly of buckminsterfullerene (C60) into ordered superstructures. A previously engineered tetrameric helical bundle binds C60 in solution, rendering it water soluble. Two tetramers associate with one C60, promoting further organization revealed in a 1.67-\u00c5 crystal structure. Fullerene groups occupy periodic lattice sites, sandwiched between two Tyr residues from adjacent tetramers. Strikingly, the assembly exhibits high charge conductance, whereas both the protein-alone crystal and amorphous C60 are electrically insulating. The affinity of C60 for its crystal-binding site is estimated to be in the nanomolar range, with lattices of known protein crystals geometrically compatible with incorporating the motif. Taken together, these findings suggest a new means of organizing fullerene molecules into a rich variety of lattices to generate new properties by design.",

        "abstract":"Learning to engineer self-assembly would enable the precise organization of molecules by design to create matter with tailored properties. Here we demonstrate that proteins can direct the self-assembly of buckminsterfullerene (C60) into ordered superstructures. A previously engineered tetrameric helical bundle binds C60 in solution, rendering it water soluble. Two tetramers associate with one C60, promoting further organization revealed in a 1.67-\u00c5 crystal structure. Fullerene groups occupy periodic lattice sites, sandwiched between two Tyr residues from adjacent tetramers. Strikingly, the assembly exhibits high charge conductance, whereas both the protein-alone crystal and amorphous C60 are electrically insulating. The affinity of C60 for its crystal-binding site is estimated to be in the nanomolar range, with lattices of known protein crystals geometrically compatible with incorporating the motif. Taken together, these findings suggest a new means of organizing fullerene molecules into a rich variety of lattices to generate new properties by design.",

        "abstract":"Learning to engineer self-assembly would enable the precise organization of molecules by design to create matter with tailored properties. Here we demonstrate that proteins can direct the self-assembly of buckminsterfullerene (C60) into ordered superstructures. A previously engineered tetrameric helical bundle binds C60 in solution, rendering it water soluble. Two tetramers associate with one C60, promoting further organization revealed in a 1.67-\u00c5 crystal structure. Fullerene groups occupy periodic lattice sites, sandwiched between two Tyr residues from adjacent tetramers. Strikingly, the assembly exhibits high charge conductance, whereas both the protein-alone crystal and amorphous C60 are electrically insulating. The affinity of C60 for its crystal-binding site is estimated to be in the nanomolar range, with lattices of known protein crystals geometrically compatible with incorporating the motif. Taken together, these findings suggest a new means of organizing fullerene molecules into a rich variety of lattices to generate new properties by design.",

        "abstract":"Self-assembling cyclic protein homo-oligomers play important roles in biology, and the ability to generate custom homo-oligomeric structures could enable new approaches to probe biological function. Here we report a general approach to design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to assess the designability of a protein-protein interface.

        "abstract":"Self-assembling cyclic protein homo-oligomers play important roles in biology, and the ability to generate custom homo-oligomeric structures could enable new approaches to probe biological function. Here we report a general approach to design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to assess the designability of a protein-protein interface. This method is sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models. X-ray crystal structures were obtained for five of the designs and each is very close to their corresponding computational model.",

        "abstract":"Active sites and ligand-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by curved \u03b2 sheets, and the ability to control \u03b2-sheet curvature would allow design of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling \u03b2-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of \u03b2 sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved \u03b2 sheets topped with \u03b1 helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that \u03b2-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.",

        "abstract":"Although metal ion binding to naturally occurring l-amino acid proteins is well documented, understanding the impact of the opposite chirality (d-)amino acids on the structure and stereochemistry of metals is in its infancy. We examine the effect of a d-configuration cysteine within a designed l-amino acid three-stranded coiled coil in order to enforce a precise coordination number on a metal center. The d chirality does not alter the native fold, but the side-chain re-orientation modifies the sterics of the metal binding pocket. l-Cys side chains within the coiled-coil structure have previously been shown to rotate substantially from their preferred positions in the apo structure to create a binding site for a tetra-coordinate metal ion. However, here we show by X-ray crystallography that d-Cys side chains are preorganized within a suitable geometry to bind such a ligand. This is confirmed by comparison of the structure of Zn II  Cl(CSL16 D  C) 3  2-  to the published structure of Zn II  (H 2  O)(GRAND-CSL12AL16 L  C) 3  -  . Moreover, spectroscopic analysis indicates that the Cd II  geometry observed by using l-Cys ligands (a mixture of three- and four-coordinate Cd II  ) is altered to a single four-coordinate species when d-Cys is present. This work opens a new avenue for the control of the metal site environment in man-made proteins, by simply altering the binding ligand with its mirror-imaged d configuration. Thus, the use of non-coded amino acids in the coordination sphere of a metal promises to be a powerful tool for controlling the properties of future metalloproteins.",

This work opens a new avenue for the control of the metal site environment in man-made proteins, by simply altering the binding ligand with its mirror-imaged d configuration. Thus, the use of non-coded amino acids in the coordination sphere of a metal promises to be a powerful tool for controlling the properties of future metalloproteins.",

        "abstract":"Throughout biology, amyloids are key structures in both functional proteins and the end product of pathologic protein misfolding. Amyloids might also represent an early precursor in the evolution of life because of their small molecular size and their ability to self-purify and catalyze chemical reactions. They also provide attractive backbones for advanced materials. When \u03b2-strands of an amyloid are arranged parallel and in register, side chains from the same position of each chain align, facilitating metal chelation when the residues are good ligands such as histidine. High-resolution structures of metalloamyloids are needed to understand the molecular bases of metal-amyloid interactions. Here we combine solid-state NMR and structural bioinformatics to determine the structure of a zinc-bound metalloamyloid that catalyzes ester hydrolysis. The peptide forms amphiphilic parallel \u03b2-sheets that assemble into stacked bilayers with alternating hydrophobic and polar interfaces. The hydrophobic interface is stabilized by apolar side chains from adjacent sheets, whereas the hydrated polar interface houses the Zn 2+ -binding histidines with binding geometries unusual in proteins. Each Zn 2+  has two bis-coordinated histidine ligands, which bridge adjacent strands to form an infinite metal-ligand chain along the fibril axis. A third histidine completes the protein ligand environment, leaving a free site on the Zn 2+  for water activation. This structure defines a class of materials, which we call metal-peptide frameworks. The structure reveals a delicate interplay through which metal ions stabilize the amyloid structure, which in turn shapes the ligand geometry and catalytic reactivity of Zn 2 .",

        "abstract":"The interaction of a positively charged amino acid residue with a negatively charged residue (i.e. a salt bridge) can contribute substantially to protein conformational stability, especially when two ionic groups are in close proximity. At longer distances, this stabilizing effect tends to drop off precipitously. However, several lines of evidence suggest that salt-bridge interaction could persist at longer distances if an aromatic amino acid residue were positioned between the anion and cation. Here we explore this possibility in the context of a peptide in which a Lys residue occupies the i + 8 position relative to an i-position Glu on the solvent-exposed surface of a helix-bundle homotrimer. Variable temperature circular dichroism (CD) experiments indicate that an i + 4-position Trp enables a favorable long-range interaction between Glu and the i + 8 Lys. A substantial portion of this effect relies on the presence of a hydrogen-bond donor on the arene; however, non-polar arenes, a cyclic hydrocarbon, and an acyclic Leu side-chain can also enhance the long-range salt bridge, possibly by excluding water and ions from the space between Glu and Lys.",

        "abstract":"The ensemble of native, folded state was once considered to represent the global energy minimum of a given protein sequence. More recently, the discovery of the cross-\u03b2 amyloid state revealed that deeper energy minima exist, often associated with pathogenic, fibrillar deposits, when the concentration of proteins reaches a critical value. Fortunately, a sizable energy barrier impedes the conversion from native to pathogenic states. However, little is known about the structure of the related transition state. In addition, there are indications of polymorphism in the amyloidogenic process. Here, we report the first evidence of the conversion of metastable cross-\u03b1-helical crystals to thermodynamically stable cross-\u03b2-sheet-like fibrils by a de novo designed heptapeptide. Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrate at atomic resolution that the flip of a peptide plane from a type I to a type II' turn facilitates transformation to cross-\u03b2 structure and assembly of a dry steric zipper. This study establishes the potential of a peptide turn, a common protein secondary structure, to serve as a principal gatekeeper between a native metastable folded state and the amyloid state.",

A recently discovered antiparallel coiled-coil hexamer (ACC-Hex, peptide 1) exhibits a unique interaction in which Phe and Ile residues from adjacent \u03b1-helices interact to form a Phe-Ile zipper within the hydrophobic core. Analysis of the X-ray crystallographic structure of ACC-Hex suggests that the stability of the six-helix bundle relies on specific interactions between the Phe and Ile residues. The Phe-Ile zipper is unprecedented and represents a powerful tool for utilizing the Phe-Ile interactions to direct supramolecular assembly. To further probe and understand the limits of the Phe-Ile zipper, we designed peptide sequences with natural and unnatural amino acids placed at the Phe and Ile residue positions. Using size exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering, we found that the proper assembly of ACC-Hex from monomers is sensitive to subtle changes in side chain steric bulk and hydrophobicity introduced by mutations at the Phe and Ile residue positions. Of the sequence variants that formed ACC-Hex, mutations in the hydrophobic core significantly affected the stability of the hexamer, from a \u0394G u  w  of 2-8 kcal mol -1 . Additional sequences were designed to further probe and enhance the stability of the ACC-Hex system by maximizing salt bridging between the solvent-exposed residues.

While there has been considerable progress in designing proteins that bind transition metal ions including iron-sulfur clusters, the design of tetranuclear clusters with oxygen-rich environments has not been accomplished. Here, we describe the design of tetranuclear clusters, consisting of four Zn 2+  and four carboxylate oxygens situated at the vertices of a distorted cube-like structure. The tetra-Zn 2+  clusters are bound at a buried site within a four-helix bundle, with each helix donating a single carboxylate (Glu or Asp) and imidazole (His) ligand, as well as second- and third-shell ligands. Overall, the designed site consists of four Zn 2+  and 16 polar side chains in a fully connected hydrogen-bonded network. The designed proteins have apolar cores at the top and bottom of the bundle, which drive the assembly of the liganding residues near the center of the bundle. The steric bulk of the apolar residues surrounding the binding site was varied to determine how subtle changes in helix-helix packing affect the binding site. The crystal structures of two of four proteins synthesized were in good agreement with the overall design; both formed a distorted cuboidal site stabilized by flanking second- and third-shell interactions that stabilize the primary ligands. A third structure bound a single Zn 2+  in an unanticipated geometry, and the fourth bound multiple Zn 2+  at multiple sites at partial occupancy. The metal-binding and conformational properties of the helical bundles in solution, probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and NMR, were consistent with the crystal structures.",

        "abstract":"De novo design provides an attractive approach to test the mechanism by which metalloproteins define the geometry and reactivity of their metal ion cofactors. While there has been considerable progress in designing proteins that bind transition metal ions including iron-sulfur clusters, the design of tetranuclear clusters with oxygen-rich environments has not been accomplished. Here, we describe the design of tetranuclear clusters, consisting of four Zn 2+  and four carboxylate oxygens situated at the vertices of a distorted cube-like structure. The tetra-Zn 2+  clusters are bound at a buried site within a four-helix bundle, with each helix donating a single carboxylate (Glu or Asp) and imidazole (His) ligand, as well as second- and third-shell ligands. Overall, the designed site consists of four Zn 2+  and 16 polar side chains in a fully connected hydrogen-bonded network. The designed proteins have apolar cores at the top and bottom of the bundle, which drive the assembly of the liganding residues near the center of the bundle. The steric bulk of the apolar residues surrounding the binding site was varied to determine how subtle changes in helix-helix packing affect the binding site. The crystal structures of two of four proteins synthesized were in good agreement with the overall design; both formed a distorted cuboidal site stabilized by flanking second- and third-shell interactions that stabilize the primary ligands. A third structure bound a single Zn 2+  in an unanticipated geometry, and the fourth bound multiple Zn 2+  at multiple sites at partial occupancy. The metal-binding and conformational properties of the helical bundles in solution, probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and NMR, were consistent with the crystal structures.",

        "abstract":"One-quarter of the 28 types of natural collagen exist as heterotrimers. The oligomerization state of collagen affects the structure and mechanics of the extracellular matrix, providing essential cues to modulate biological and pathological processes. A lack of high-resolution structural information limits our mechanistic understanding of collagen heterospecific self-assembly. Here, the 1.77-\u00c5 resolution structure of a synthetic heterotrimer demonstrates the balance of intermolecular electrostatics and hydrogen bonding that affects collagen stability and heterospecificity of assembly. Atomistic simulations and mutagenesis based on the solved structure are used to explore the contributions of specific interactions to energetics. A predictive model of collagen stability and specificity is developed for engineering novel collagen structures.",

We report the design of transmembrane monomers, homodimers, trimers, and tetramers with 76 to 215 residue subunits containing two to four membrane-spanning regions and up to 860 total residues that adopt the target oligomerization state in detergent solution. The designed proteins localize to the plasma membrane in bacteria and in mammalian cells, and magnetic tweezer unfolding experiments in the membrane indicate that they are very stable. Crystal structures of the designed dimer and tetramer-a rocket-shaped structure with a wide cytoplasmic base that funnels into eight transmembrane helices-are very close to the design models.

        "abstract":"The computational design of transmembrane proteins with more than one membrane-spanning region remains a major challenge. We report the design of transmembrane monomers, homodimers, trimers, and tetramers with 76 to 215 residue subunits containing two to four membrane-spanning regions and up to 860 total residues that adopt the target oligomerization state in detergent solution. The designed proteins localize to the plasma membrane in bacteria and in mammalian cells, and magnetic tweezer unfolding experiments in the membrane indicate that they are very stable. Crystal structures of the designed dimer and tetramer-a rocket-shaped structure with a wide cytoplasmic base that funnels into eight transmembrane helices-are very close to the design models. Our results pave the way for the design of multispan membrane proteins with new functions.",

        "abstract":"The regular arrangements of \u03b2-strands around a central axis in \u03b2-barrels and of \u03b1-helices in coiled coils contrast with the irregular tertiary structures of most globular proteins, and have fascinated structural biologists since they were first discovered. Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with \u03b2-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of \u03b2-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of \u03b2-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI,\u00a0and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures.",

Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with \u03b2-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of \u03b2-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of \u03b2-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI,\u00a0and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures.",

        "abstract":"The regular arrangements of \u03b2-strands around a central axis in \u03b2-barrels and of \u03b1-helices in coiled coils contrast with the irregular tertiary structures of most globular proteins, and have fascinated structural biologists since they were first discovered. Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with \u03b2-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of \u03b2-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of \u03b2-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI,\u00a0and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures.",

        "abstract":"The Trp-cage, an 18-20 residue miniprotein, has emerged as a primary test system for evaluating computational fold prediction and folding rate determination efforts. As it turns out, a number of stabilizing interactions in the Trp-cage folded state have a strong pH dependence; all prior Trp-cage mutants have been destabilized under carboxylate-protonating conditions. Notable among the pH dependent stabilizing interactions within the Trp-cage are: (1) an Asp as the helix N-cap, (2) an H-bonded Asp9\/Arg16 salt bridge, (3) an interaction between the chain termini which are in close spatial proximity, and (4) additional side chain interactions with Asp9. In the present study, we have prepared Trp-cage species that are significantly more stable at pH 2.5 (rather than 7) and quantitated the contribution of each interaction listed above. The Trp-cage structure remains constant with the pH change. The study has also provided measures of the stabilizing contribution of indole ring shielding from surface exposure and the destabilizing effects of an ionized Asp at the C-terminus of an \u03b1-helix.",

Systematic replacement of a subset of natural \u03b1-residues with various artificial building blocks in the context of a computationally designed prototype sequence leads to \"heterogeneous-backbone\" variants that undergo clean oxidative folding, adopt tertiary structures indistinguishable from that of the prototype, and enjoy proteolytic protection beyond that inherent to the topologically constrained scaffold. Collectively, these results demonstrate systematic backbone substitution to be a viable method to engineer the properties of disulfide-rich sequences and expands the repertoire of protein mimicry by foldamers to an exciting new structural class.",

So far, this approach has primarily exploited amplification, effectively harnessing the internal folding propensity of self-compatible fragments to achieve sufficient enthalpy for folding. Here we exploit an interface-driven strategy to depart from the repeat design realm, constructing an asymmetric, globular domain from heterologous supersecondary structures. We report the successful design of a dRP lyase domain fold, which agrees with the experimental NMR structure at atomic accuracy (backbone RMSD of 0.94\u202f\u00c5). Our results show that the residual folding information within conserved fragments, combined with efficient interface-directed sampling, can effectively yield globular proteins with novel sequences and biophysical properties.",

        "abstract":"Designing peptides that fold and assemble in response to metal ions tests our understanding of how peptide folding and metal binding influence one another. Here, histidine residues are introduced into the hydrophobic core of a coiled-coil trimer, generating a peptide that self-assembles upon the addition of metal ions. HisAD, the resulting peptide, is unstructured in the absence of metal and folds selectively to form an \u03b1-helical construct upon complexation with Cu(ii) and Ni(ii) but not Co(ii) or Zn(ii). The structure, and metal-binding ability, of HisAD is probed using a combination of circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. These show the peptide is trimeric and binds to both Cu(ii) and Ni(ii) in a 1\u2009:\u20091 ratio with the histidine residues involved in the metal coordination, as designed. The X-ray crystal structure of the HisAD-Cu(ii) complex reveals the trimeric HisAD peptide coordinates three Cu(ii) ions; this is the first example of such a structure. Additionally, HisAD demonstrates an unprecedented discrimination between transition metal ions, the basis of which is likely to be related to the stability of the peptide-metal complexes formed.",

Synthetic amphiphilic peptides have been found to form ion channels 5,6 , and there have been recent advances in de novo membrane protein design 7,8  and in redesigning naturally occurring channel-containing proteins 9,10 . However, the de novo design of stable, well-defined transmembrane protein pores that are capable of conducting ions selectively or are large enough to enable the passage of small-molecule fluorophores remains an outstanding challenge 11,12 . Here we report the computational design of protein pores formed by two concentric rings of \u03b1-helices that are stable and monodisperse in both their water-soluble and their transmembrane forms. Crystal structures of the water-soluble forms of a 12-helical pore and a 16-helical pore closely match the computational design models. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments show that, when expressed in insect cells, the transmembrane form of the 12-helix pore enables the passage of ions across the membrane with high selectivity for potassium over sodium; ion passage is blocked by specific chemical modification at the pore entrance. When incorporated into liposomes using in vitro protein synthesis, the transmembrane form of the 16-helix pore-but not the 12-helix pore-enables the passage of biotinylated Alexa Fluor 488. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 16-helix transmembrane pore closely matches the design model. The ability to produce structurally and functionally well-defined transmembrane pores opens the door to the creation of designer channels and pores for a wide variety of applications.",

        "abstract":"Transmembrane channels and pores have key roles in fundamental biological processes 1  and in biotechnological applications such as DNA nanopore sequencing 2-4 , resulting in considerable interest in the design of pore-containing proteins. Synthetic amphiphilic peptides have been found to form ion channels 5,6 , and there have been recent advances in de novo membrane protein design 7,8  and in redesigning naturally occurring channel-containing proteins 9,10 . However, the de novo design of stable, well-defined transmembrane protein pores that are capable of conducting ions selectively or are large enough to enable the passage of small-molecule fluorophores remains an outstanding challenge 11,12 . Here we report the computational design of protein pores formed by two concentric rings of \u03b1-helices that are stable and monodisperse in both their water-soluble and their transmembrane forms. Crystal structures of the water-soluble forms of a 12-helical pore and a 16-helical pore closely match the computational design models. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments show that, when expressed in insect cells, the transmembrane form of the 12-helix pore enables the passage of ions across the membrane with high selectivity for potassium over sodium; ion passage is blocked by specific chemical modification at the pore entrance. When incorporated into liposomes using in vitro protein synthesis, the transmembrane form of the 16-helix pore-but not the 12-helix pore-enables the passage of biotinylated Alexa Fluor 488. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 16-helix transmembrane pore closely matches the design model. The ability to produce structurally and functionally well-defined transmembrane pores opens the door to the creation of designer channels and pores for a wide variety of applications.",

        "abstract":"Three-stranded coiled coils are peptide structures constructed from amphipathic heptad repeats. Here we show that it is possible to form pure heterotrimeric three-stranded coiled coils by combining three distinct characteristics: (1) a cysteine sulfur layer for metal coordination, (2) a thiophilic, trigonal pyramidal metalloid (Pb(II)) that binds to these sulfurs and (3) an adjacent layer of reduced steric bulk generating a cavity where water can hydrogen bond to the cysteine sulfur atoms. Cysteine substitution in an a site yields Pb(II)A 2 B heterotrimers, while d sites provide pure Pb(II)C 2 D or Pb(II)CD 2  scaffolds. Altering the metal from Pb(II) to Hg(II) or shifting the relative position of the sterically less demanding layer removes heterotrimer specificity. Because only two of the eight or ten hydrophobic layers are perturbed, catalytic sites can be introduced at other regions of the scaffold. A Zn(II)(histidine) 3 (H 2 O) centre can be incorporated at a remote location without perturbing the heterotrimer selectivity, suggesting a unique strategy to prepare dissymmetric catalytic sites within self-assembling de novo-designed proteins.",

        "abstract":"The features that stabilize the structures of membrane proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain packing in membranes. Disruption of steric packing can destabilize the native folds of membrane proteins, but is packing alone sufficient to drive folding in lipids? If so, then membrane proteins stabilized by this feature should be readily designed and structurally characterized-yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and redesign of variants, we define a steric packing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic membrane proteins designed using this code and stabilized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended fold. Although highly stable, the steric complementarity required for their folding is surprisingly stringent. Structural informatics shows that the designed packing motif recurs across the proteome, emphasizing a prominent role for precise apolar packing in membrane protein folding, stabilization, and evolution.",

        "abstract":"Online citizen science projects such as GalaxyZoo 1 , Eyewire 2  and Phylo 3  have proven very successful for data collection, annotation and processing, but for the most part have harnessed human pattern-recognition skills rather than human creativity. An exception is the game EteRNA 4 , in which game players learn to build new RNA structures by exploring the discrete two-dimensional space of Watson-Crick base pairing possibilities. Building new proteins, however, is a more challenging task to present in a game, as both the representation and evaluation of a protein structure are intrinsically three-dimensional. We posed the challenge of de novo protein design in the online protein-folding game Foldit 5 . Players were presented with a fully extended peptide chain and challenged to craft a folded protein structure and an amino acid sequence encoding that structure. After many iterations of player design, analysis of the top-scoring solutions and subsequent game improvement, Foldit players can now-starting from an extended polypeptide chain-generate a diversity of protein structures and sequences that encode them in silico. One hundred forty-six Foldit player designs with sequences unrelated to naturally occurring proteins were encoded in synthetic genes; 56 were found to be expressed and soluble in Escherichia coli, and to adopt stable monomeric folded structures in solution. The diversity of these structures is unprecedented in de novo protein design, representing 20 different folds-including a new fold not observed in natural proteins. High-resolution structures were determined for four of the designs, and are nearly identical to the player models. This work makes explicit the considerable implicit knowledge\u00a0that contributes to success in de novo protein design, and shows that citizen scientists can discover creative new solutions to outstanding scientific challenges such as the protein design problem.",

An exception is the game EteRNA 4 , in which game players learn to build new RNA structures by exploring the discrete two-dimensional space of Watson-Crick base pairing possibilities. Building new proteins, however, is a more challenging task to present in a game, as both the representation and evaluation of a protein structure are intrinsically three-dimensional. We posed the challenge of de novo protein design in the online protein-folding game Foldit 5 . Players were presented with a fully extended peptide chain and challenged to craft a folded protein structure and an amino acid sequence encoding that structure. After many iterations of player design, analysis of the top-scoring solutions and subsequent game improvement, Foldit players can now-starting from an extended polypeptide chain-generate a diversity of protein structures and sequences that encode them in silico. One hundred forty-six Foldit player designs with sequences unrelated to naturally occurring proteins were encoded in synthetic genes; 56 were found to be expressed and soluble in Escherichia coli, and to adopt stable monomeric folded structures in solution. The diversity of these structures is unprecedented in de novo protein design, representing 20 different folds-including a new fold not observed in natural proteins. High-resolution structures were determined for four of the designs, and are nearly identical to the player models. This work makes explicit the considerable implicit knowledge\u00a0that contributes to success in de novo protein design, and shows that citizen scientists can discover creative new solutions to outstanding scientific challenges such as the protein design problem.",

An exception is the game EteRNA 4 , in which game players learn to build new RNA structures by exploring the discrete two-dimensional space of Watson-Crick base pairing possibilities. Building new proteins, however, is a more challenging task to present in a game, as both the representation and evaluation of a protein structure are intrinsically three-dimensional. We posed the challenge of de novo protein design in the online protein-folding game Foldit 5 . Players were presented with a fully extended peptide chain and challenged to craft a folded protein structure and an amino acid sequence encoding that structure. After many iterations of player design, analysis of the top-scoring solutions and subsequent game improvement, Foldit players can now-starting from an extended polypeptide chain-generate a diversity of protein structures and sequences that encode them in silico. One hundred forty-six Foldit player designs with sequences unrelated to naturally occurring proteins were encoded in synthetic genes; 56 were found to be expressed and soluble in Escherichia coli, and to adopt stable monomeric folded structures in solution. The diversity of these structures is unprecedented in de novo protein design, representing 20 different folds-including a new fold not observed in natural proteins. High-resolution structures were determined for four of the designs, and are nearly identical to the player models. This work makes explicit the considerable implicit knowledge\u00a0that contributes to success in de novo protein design, and shows that citizen scientists can discover creative new solutions to outstanding scientific challenges such as the protein design problem.",

Recently, a toxic peptide was proposed to form amyloid-like cross-\u03b1 structures in solution, with a planar bilayer-like assembly observed in the crystal structure. Here we crystallographically characterize designed peptides that assemble into spiraling cross-\u03b1 amyloid-like structures, which resemble twisted \u03b2-amyloid fibrils. The peptides form helical dimers, stabilized by packing of small and apolar residues, and the dimers further assemble into cross-\u03b1 amyloid-like fibrils with superhelical pitches ranging from 170\u2009\u00c5 to 200\u2009\u00c5. When a small residue that appeared critical for packing was converted to leucine, it resulted in structural rearrangement to a helical polymer. Fluorescently tagged versions of the designed peptides form puncta in mammalian cells, which recover from photobleaching with markedly different kinetics. These structural folds could be potentially useful for directing in vivo protein assemblies with predetermined spacing and stabilities.",

The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair. Our results highlight the exquisite complexity and surprising long-range synergistic interactions among  b -,  c -, and  f -position residues within helix bundles, suggesting new possibilities for engineering hyperstable helix bundles and emphasizing the need to consider carefully the impact of substitutions at these positions for application-specific purposes.",

        "abstract":"Hydrophobic interactions govern how proteins fold and interact with other molecules, but the impact of nearby polar functionality on the effective hydrophobicity of nonpolar surfaces remains unclear. Here we use a common protein quaternary structure motif, the parallel coiled-coil dimer, to ask whether the identity of basic residues (arginine vs lysine; guanidinium vs ammonium) arrayed along one side of the constituent \u03b1-helices influences the favorability of dimerization driven by burial of hydrophobic surface on the other side of each helix. Significant sequence redesign was necessary to achieve the desired juxtaposition of nonpolar and cationic functionality, because we needed to eliminate charged side chains from positions flanking the nonpolar helix surface. Natural and designed sequences that form coiled coils are almost universally rich in acidic and basic residues at these flanking positions. Our arginine coiled-coil dimer was moderately more stable than the lysine analogue, which contrasts with behavior previously observed with helical \u03b2-amino acid oligomers bearing guanidinium versus ammonium groups. We attribute this backbone-dependent difference to variations in the extent to which the helical propensities of \u03b1- and \u03b2-residues can be modulated by design. These findings highlight the challenge of identifying noncovalent forces that direct structure formed by a flexible backbone.",

        "abstract":"The optimization of compounds with multiple targets is a difficult multidimensional problem in the drug discovery cycle. Here, we present a systematic, multidisciplinary approach to the development of selective antiparasitic compounds. Computational fragment-based design of novel pteridine derivatives along with iterations of crystallographic structure determination allowed for the derivation of a structure-activity relationship for multitarget inhibition. The approach yielded compounds showing apparent picomolar inhibition of  T. brucei  pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1), nanomolar inhibition of  L. major  PTR1, and selective submicromolar inhibition of parasite dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) versus human DHFR. Moreover, by combining design for polypharmacology with a property-based on-parasite optimization, we found three compounds that exhibited micromolar EC 50  values against  T. brucei brucei  while retaining their target inhibition. Our results provide a basis for the further development of pteridine-based compounds, and we expect our multitarget approach to be generally applicable to the design and optimization of anti-infective agents.",

        "abstract":"\u03b2-Propellers arise through the amplification of a supersecondary structure element called a blade. This process produces toroids of between four and twelve repeats, which are almost always arranged sequentially in a single polypeptide chain. We found that new propellers evolve continuously by amplification from single blades. We therefore investigated whether such nascent propellers can fold as homo-oligomers before they have been fully amplified within a single chain. One- to six-bladed building blocks derived from two seven-bladed WD40 propellers yielded stable homo-oligomers with six to nine blades, depending on the size of the building block. High-resolution structures for tetramers of two blades, trimers of three blades, and dimers of four and five blades, respectively, show structurally diverse propellers and include a novel fold, highlighting the inherent flexibility of the WD40 blade. Our data support the hypothesis that subdomain-sized fragments can provide structural versatility in the evolution of new proteins.",

The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair. Our results highlight the exquisite complexity and surprising long-range synergistic interactions among  b -,  c -, and  f -position residues within helix bundles, suggesting new possibilities for engineering hyperstable helix bundles and emphasizing the need to consider carefully the impact of substitutions at these positions for application-specific purposes.",

        "abstract":"Cyclic symmetry is frequent in protein and peptide homo-oligomers, but extremely rare within a single chain, as it is not compatible with free N- and C-termini. Here we describe the computational design of mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles with rigid structures that feature internal cyclic symmetries or improper rotational symmetries inaccessible to natural proteins. Crystal structures of three C2- and C3-symmetric macrocycles, and of six diverse S2-symmetric macrocycles, match the computationally-designed models with backbone heavy-atom RMSD values of 1 \u00c5 or better. Crystal structures of an S4-symmetric macrocycle (consisting of a sequence and structure segment mirrored at each of three successive repeats) designed to bind zinc reveal a large-scale zinc-driven conformational change from an S4-symmetric apo-state to a nearly inverted S4-symmetric holo-state almost identical to the design model. These symmetric structures provide promising starting points for applications ranging from design of cyclic peptide based metal organic frameworks to creation of high affinity binders of symmetric protein homo-oligomers. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of computational design for exploring symmetries and structures not found in nature, and for creating synthetic switchable systems.",

Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair.

        "abstract":"Here we show that a solvent-exposed  f -position (i.e., residue 14) within a well-characterized trimeric helix bundle can facilitate a stabilizing long-range synergistic interaction involving  b -position Glu10 (i.e.,  i  - 4 relative to residue 14) and  c -position Lys18 (i.e.,  i  + 4), depending the identity of residue 14. The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair. Our results highlight the exquisite complexity and surprising long-range synergistic interactions among  b -,  c -, and  f -position residues within helix bundles, suggesting new possibilities for engineering hyperstable helix bundles and emphasizing the need to consider carefully the impact of substitutions at these positions for application-specific purposes.",

        "abstract":"Collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) self-assemble into a triple helix reproducing the most fundamental aspect of the collagen structural hierarchy. They are therefore important for both further understanding this complex family of proteins and use in a wide range of biomaterials and biomedical applications. CMP self-assembly is complicated by a number of factors which limit the use of CMPs including their slow rate of folding, relatively poor monomer-trimer equilibrium, and the large number of competing species possible in heterotrimeric helices. All of these problems can be solved through the formation of isopeptide bonds between lysine and either aspartate or glutamate. These amino acids serve two purposes: they first direct self-assemble, allowing for composition and register control within the triple helix, and subsequently can be covalently linked, fixing the composition and register of the assembled structure without perturbing the triple helical conformation. This self-assembly and covalent capture are demonstrated here with four different triple helices. The formation of an isopeptide bond between lysine and glutamate (K-E) is shown to be a faster and higher yielding reaction than lysine with aspartate (K-D). Additionally, K-E amide bonds increase the thermal stability, improve the refolding capabilities, and enhance the triple helical structure as compared to K-E supramolecular interactions, observed by circular dichroism. In contrast, covalent capture of triple helices with K-D amide bonds occurs slower, and the captured triple helices do not have enhanced helical structure. The crystal structure of a triple helix captured through the formation of three K-E isopeptide bonds unequivocally demonstrates the connectivity of the amide bonds formed while also confirming the preservation of the canonical triple helix. The rate of reaction and yield for covalently captured K-E triple helices along with the excellent preservation of triple helical structure demonstrate that this approach can be used to effectively capture and stabilize this important biological motif for biological and biomedical applications.",

Although the different amino acid propensities for the Xaa and Yaa positions of collagen's repeating (Glycine-Xaa-Yaa) primary structure have been described, our understanding of the impact of incorporating aza-glycine (azGly) residues adjacent to varied Xaa and Yaa position residues has been limited to specific sequences. Here, we detail the impact of variation in the Xaa position adjacent to an azGly residue and compare these results to our study on the impact of the Yaa position. For the first time, we present a set of design rules for azGly-stabilized triple-helical collagen peptides, accounting for all canonical amino acids in the Xaa and Yaa positions adjacent to an azGly residue, and extend these rules using multiple azGly residues. To gain atomic level insight into these new rules we present two high-resolution crystal structures of collagen triple helices, with the first peptoid-containing collagen peptide structure. In conjunction with biophysical and computational data, we highlight the critical importance of preserving the triple helix geometry and protecting the hydrogen bonding network proximal to the azGly residue from solvent. Our results provide a set of design guidelines for azGly-stabilized triple-helical collagen peptides and fundamental insight into collagen structure and stability.",

        "abstract":"The design of modular protein logic for regulating protein function at the posttranscriptional level is a challenge for synthetic biology. Here, we describe the design of two-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates built from de novo-designed proteins. These gates regulate the association of arbitrary protein units ranging from split enzymes to transcriptional machinery in vitro, in yeast and in primary human T cells, where they control the expression of the  TIM3  gene related to T cell exhaustion. Designed binding interaction cooperativity, confirmed by native mass spectrometry, makes the gates largely insensitive to stoichiometric imbalances in the inputs, and the modularity of the approach enables ready extension to three-input OR, AND, and disjunctive normal form gates. The modularity and cooperativity of the control elements, coupled with the ability to de novo design an essentially unlimited number of protein components, should enable the design of sophisticated posttranslational control logic over a wide range of biological functions.",

To improve the robustness of designed homotetramers, additional sequences based on CC-Tet were produced and characterized in solution and by X-ray crystallography.

To improve the robustness of designed homotetramers, additional sequences based on CC-Tet were produced and characterized in solution and by X-ray crystallography. Of these updated sequences, one is robust to truncation and to changes in surface electrostatics; we call this CC-Tet*. Variants of the general CC-Tet* design provide a set of homotetrameric coiled coils with unfolding temperatures in the range from 40 to >95 \u00b0C. We anticipate that these will be of use in applications requiring robust and well-defined tetramerization domains.",

        "abstract":"De novo protein design is advancing rapidly. However, most designs are for single states. Here we report a de novo designed peptide that forms multiple \u03b1-helical-bundle states that are accessible and interconvertible under the same conditions. Usually in such designs amphipathic \u03b1 helices associate to form compact structures with consolidated hydrophobic cores. However, recent rational and computational designs have delivered open \u03b1-helical barrels with functionalisable cavities. By placing glycine judiciously in the helical interfaces of an \u03b1-helical barrel, we obtain both open and compact states in a single protein crystal. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate a free-energy landscape with multiple and interconverting states. Together, these findings suggest a frustrated system in which steric interactions that maintain the open barrel and the hydrophobic effect that drives complete collapse are traded-off. Indeed, addition of a hydrophobic co-solvent that can bind within the barrel affects the switch between the states both in silico and experimentally.",

        "abstract":"Precise cell targeting is challenging because most mammalian cell types lack a single surface marker that distinguishes them from other cells. A solution would be to target cells using specific combinations of proteins present on their surfaces. In this study, we design colocalization-dependent protein switches (Co-LOCKR) that perform AND, OR, and NOT Boolean logic operations. These switches activate through a conformational change only when all conditions are met, generating rapid, transcription-independent responses at single-cell resolution within complex cell populations. We implement AND gates to redirect T cell specificity against tumor cells expressing two surface antigens while avoiding off-target recognition of single-antigen cells, and three-input switches that add NOT or OR logic to avoid or include cells expressing a third antigen. Thus, de novo designed proteins can perform computations on the surface of cells, integrating multiple distinct binding interactions into a single output.",

In SDS-PAGE, A\u03b2m 17-36  assembles to form a ladder of oligomers, while A\u03b2m 17-35  either assembles to form a dimer or does not assemble at all. The differences in the behavior of A\u03b2m 17-36  and A\u03b2m 17-35  suggest \u03b2-hairpin alignment as a source of the observed heterogeneity of A\u03b2 oligomers.",

        "abstract":"Natural proteins are highly optimized for function but are often difficult to produce at a scale suitable for biotechnological applications due to poor expression in heterologous systems, limited solubility, and sensitivity to temperature. Thus, a general method that improves the physical properties of native proteins while maintaining function could have wide utility for protein-based technologies. Here, we show that the deep neural network ProteinMPNN, together with evolutionary and structural information, provides a route to increasing protein expression, stability, and function. For both myoglobin and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, we generated designs with improved expression, elevated melting temperatures, and improved function. For TEV protease, we identified multiple designs with improved catalytic activity as compared to the parent sequence and previously reported TEV variants. Our approach should be broadly useful for improving the expression, stability, and function of biotechnologically important proteins.",

De novo protein design can now generate binders with high affinity and specificity to structured proteins 6,7 . However, the design of interactions between proteins and short peptides with helical propensity is an unmet challenge. Here we describe parametric generation and deep learning-based methods for designing proteins to address this challenge. We show that by extending RFdiffusion 8  to enable binder design to flexible targets, and to refining input structure models by successive noising and denoising (partial diffusion), picomolar-affinity binders can be generated to helical peptide targets by either\u00a0refining designs generated with other methods, or completely de novo starting from random noise distributions\u00a0without any subsequent experimental optimization. The RFdiffusion designs enable the enrichment and subsequent detection of parathyroid hormone and glucagon by mass spectrometry, and the construction of bioluminescence-based protein biosensors. The ability to design binders to conformationally variable targets, and to optimize by partial diffusion both natural and designed proteins, should be broadly useful.",

De novo protein design can now generate binders with high affinity and specificity to structured proteins 6,7 . However, the design of interactions between proteins and short peptides with helical propensity is an unmet challenge. Here we describe parametric generation and deep learning-based methods for designing proteins to address this challenge. We show that by extending RFdiffusion 8  to enable binder design to flexible targets, and to refining input structure models by successive noising and denoising (partial diffusion), picomolar-affinity binders can be generated to helical peptide targets by either\u00a0refining designs generated with other methods, or completely de novo starting from random noise distributions\u00a0without any subsequent experimental optimization. The RFdiffusion designs enable the enrichment and subsequent detection of parathyroid hormone and glucagon by mass spectrometry, and the construction of bioluminescence-based protein biosensors. The ability to design binders to conformationally variable targets, and to optimize by partial diffusion both natural and designed proteins, should be broadly useful.",

We hypothesized that heterogeneous nucleation of calcium carbonate could be achieved by a structured flat molecular template that pre-organizes calcium ions on its surface. To test this hypothesis, we design helical repeat proteins (DHRs) displaying regularly spaced carboxylate arrays on their surfaces and find that both protein monomers and protein-Ca 2+  supramolecular assemblies directly nucleate nano-calcite with non-natural {110} or {202} faces while vaterite, which forms first in the absence of the proteins, is bypassed. These protein-stabilized nanocrystals then assemble by oriented attachment into calcite mesocrystals. We find further that nanocrystal size and polymorph can be tuned by varying the length and surface chemistry of the designed protein templates. Thus, bio-mineralization can be programmed using de novo protein design, providing a route to next-generation hybrid materials.",

        "abstract":"Protein crystallization plays a central role in structural biology. Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable.

Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

        "abstract":"Protein crystallization plays a central role in structural biology. Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

        "abstract":"De novo protein design methods can create proteins with folds not yet seen in nature. These methods largely focus on optimizing the compatibility between the designed sequence and the intended conformation, without explicit consideration of protein folding pathways. Deeply knotted proteins, whose topologies may introduce substantial barriers to folding, thus represent an interesting test case for protein design. Here we report our attempts to design proteins with trefoil (3 1 ) and pentafoil (5 1 ) knotted topologies. We extended previously described algorithms for tandem repeat protein design in order to construct deeply knotted backbones and matching designed repeat sequences (N\u2009=\u20093 repeats for the trefoil and N\u2009=\u20095 for the pentafoil). We confirmed the intended conformation for the trefoil design by X ray crystallography, and we report here on this protein's structure, stability, and folding behaviour. The pentafoil design misfolded into an asymmetric structure (despite a 5-fold symmetric sequence); two of the four repeat-repeat units matched the designed backbone while the other two diverged to form local contacts, leading to a trefoil rather than pentafoil knotted topology. Our results also provide insights into the folding of knotted proteins.",

        "abstract":"Antibody derivatives have sought to recapitulate the antigen binding properties of antibodies, but with improved biophysical attributes convenient for therapeutic, diagnostic and research applications. However, their success has been limited by the naturally occurring structure of the immunoglobulin dimer displaying hypervariable binding loops, which is hard to modify by traditional engineering approaches. Here, we devise geometrical principles for de novo designing single-chain immunoglobulin dimers, as a tunable two-domain architecture that optimizes biophysical properties through more favorable dimer interfaces. Guided by these principles, we computationally designed protein scaffolds that were hyperstable, structurally accurate and robust for accommodating multiple functional loops, both individually and in combination, as confirmed through biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography. We showcase the modularity of this architecture by deep-learning-based diversification, opening up the possibility for tailoring the number, positioning, and relative orientation of ligand-binding loops targeting one or two distal epitopes. Our results provide a route to custom-design robust protein scaffolds for harboring multiple functional loops.",

        "abstract":"In pseudocyclic proteins, such as TIM barrels, \u03b2 barrels, and some helical transmembrane channels, a single subunit is repeated in a cyclic pattern, giving rise to a central cavity that can serve as a pocket for ligand binding or enzymatic activity. Inspired by these proteins, we devised a deep-learning-based approach to broadly exploring the space of closed repeat proteins starting from only a specification of the repeat number and length. Biophysical data for 38 structurally diverse pseudocyclic designs produced in Escherichia coli are consistent with the design models, and the three crystal structures we were able to obtain are very close to the designed structures. Docking studies suggest the diversity of folds and central pockets provide effective starting points for designing small-molecule binders and enzymes.",

        "abstract":"Producing novel enzymes that are catalytically active in vitro and biologically functional in vivo is a key goal of synthetic biology. Previously, we reported Syn-F4, the first de novo protein that meets both criteria. Syn-F4 hydrolyzed the siderophore ferric enterobactin, and expression of Syn-F4 allowed an inviable strain of  Escherichia coli  (\u0394 fes ) to grow in iron-limited medium. Here, we describe the crystal structure of Syn-F4. Syn-F4 forms a dimeric 4-helix bundle. Each monomer comprises two long \u03b1-helices, and the loops of the Syn-F4 dimer are on the same end of the bundle ( syn  topology). Interestingly, there is a penetrated hole in the central region of the Syn-F4 structure. Extensive mutagenesis experiments in a previous study showed that five residues (Glu26, His74, Arg77, Lys78, and Arg85) were essential for enzymatic activity in vivo. All these residues are located around the hole in the central region of the Syn-F4 structure, suggesting a putative active site with a catalytic dyad (Glu26-His74). The complete inactivity of purified proteins with mutations at the five residues supports the putative active site and reaction mechanism. Molecular dynamics and docking simulations of the ferric enterobactin siderophore binding to the Syn-F4 structure demonstrate the dynamic property of the putative active site. The structure and active site of Syn-F4 are completely different from native enterobactin esterase enzymes, thereby demonstrating that proteins designed de novo can provide life-sustaining catalytic activities using structures and mechanisms dramatically different from those that arose in nature.",

        "abstract":"Producing novel enzymes that are catalytically active in vitro and biologically functional in vivo is a key goal of synthetic biology. Previously, we reported Syn-F4, the first de novo protein that meets both criteria. Syn-F4 hydrolyzed the siderophore ferric enterobactin, and expression of Syn-F4 allowed an inviable strain of  Escherichia coli  (\u0394 fes ) to grow in iron-limited medium. Here, we describe the crystal structure of Syn-F4. Syn-F4 forms a dimeric 4-helix bundle. Each monomer comprises two long \u03b1-helices, and the loops of the Syn-F4 dimer are on the same end of the bundle ( syn  topology). Interestingly, there is a penetrated hole in the central region of the Syn-F4 structure. Extensive mutagenesis experiments in a previous study showed that five residues (Glu26, His74, Arg77, Lys78, and Arg85) were essential for enzymatic activity in vivo. All these residues are located around the hole in the central region of the Syn-F4 structure, suggesting a putative active site with a catalytic dyad (Glu26-His74). The complete inactivity of purified proteins with mutations at the five residues supports the putative active site and reaction mechanism. Molecular dynamics and docking simulations of the ferric enterobactin siderophore binding to the Syn-F4 structure demonstrate the dynamic property of the putative active site. The structure and active site of Syn-F4 are completely different from native enterobactin esterase enzymes, thereby demonstrating that proteins designed de novo can provide life-sustaining catalytic activities using structures and mechanisms dramatically different from those that arose in nature.",

        "abstract":"Targeted intracellular delivery via receptor-mediated endocytosis requires the delivered cargo to escape the endosome to prevent lysosomal degradation. This can in principle be achieved by membrane lysis tightly restricted to endosomal membranes upon internalization to avoid general membrane insertion and lysis. Here, we describe the design of small monomeric proteins with buried histidine containing pH-responsive hydrogen bond networks and membrane permeating amphipathic helices. Of the 30 designs that were experimentally tested, all expressed in Escherichia coli, 13 were monomeric with the expected secondary structure, and 4 designs disrupted artificial liposomes in a pH-dependent manner. Mutational analysis showed that the buried histidine hydrogen bond networks mediate pH-responsiveness and control lysis of model membranes within a very narrow range of pH (6.0-5.5) with almost no lysis occurring at neutral pH. These tightly controlled lytic monomers could help mediate endosomal escape in designed targeted delivery platforms.",

        "abstract":"De novo peptide design is a new frontier that has broad application potential in the biological and biomedical fields. Most existing models for de novo peptide design are largely based on sequence homology that can be restricted based on evolutionarily derived protein sequences and lack the physicochemical context essential in protein folding. Generative machine learning for de novo peptide design is a promising way to synthesize theoretical data that are based on, but unique from, the observable universe. In this study, we created and tested a custom peptide generative adversarial network intended to design peptide sequences that can fold into the \u03b2-hairpin secondary structure. This deep neural network model is designed to establish a preliminary foundation of the generative approach based on physicochemical and conformational properties of 20 canonical amino acids, for example, hydrophobicity and residue volume, using extant structure-specific sequence data from the PDB. The beta generative adversarial network model robustly distinguishes secondary structures of \u03b2 hairpin from \u03b1 helix and intrinsically disordered peptides with an accuracy of up to 96% and generates artificial \u03b2-hairpin peptide sequences with minimum sequence identities around 31% and 50% when compared against the current NCBI PDB and nonredundant databases, respectively. These results highlight the potential of generative models specifically anchored by physicochemical and conformational property features of amino acids to expand the sequence-to-structure landscape of proteins beyond evolutionary limits.",

Among proteins, alpha-helical coiled coils have such symmetric, extendable architectures, but are limited by the relatively fixed geometry and flexibility of the helical protomers. Here we describe a systematic approach to generating modular and rigid repeat protein oligomers with coincident C 2  to C 8  and superhelical symmetry axes that can be readily extended by repeat propagation. From these building blocks, we demonstrate that a wide range of unbounded fibres can be systematically designed by introducing hydrophilic surface patches that force staggering of the monomers; the geometry of such fibres can be precisely tuned by varying the number of repeat units in the monomer and the placement of the hydrophilic patches.",

        "abstract":"While native scaffolds offer a large diversity of shapes and topologies for enzyme engineering, their often unpredictable behavior in response to sequence modification makes de novo generated scaffolds an exciting alternative. Here we explore the customization of the backbone and sequence of a de novo designed eight stranded \u03b2-barrel protein to create catalysts for a retro-aldolase model reaction. We show that active and specific catalysts can be designed in this fold and use directed evolution to further optimize activity and stereoselectivity. Our results support previous suggestions that different folds have different inherent amenability to evolution and this property could account, in part, for the distribution of natural enzymes among different folds.",

        "abstract":"A challenge for design of protein-small-molecule recognition is that incorporation of cavities with size, shape, and composition suitable for specific recognition can considerably destabilize protein monomers. This challenge can be overcome through binding pockets formed at homo-oligomeric interfaces between folded monomers. Interfaces surrounding the central homo-oligomer symmetry axes necessarily have the same symmetry and so may not be well suited to binding asymmetric molecules. To enable general recognition of arbitrary asymmetric substrates and small molecules, we developed an approach to designing asymmetric interfaces at off-axis sites on homo-oligomers, analogous to those found in native homo-oligomeric proteins such as glutamine synthetase. We symmetrically dock curved helical repeat proteins such that they form pockets at the asymmetric interface of the oligomer with sizes ranging from several angstroms, appropriate for binding a single ion, to up to more than 20 \u00c5 across. Of the 133 proteins tested, 84 had soluble expression in  E. coli , 47 had correct oligomeric states in solution, 35 had small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data largely consistent with design models, and 8 had negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) 2D class averages showing the structures coming together as designed. Both an X-ray crystal structure and a cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure are close to the computational design models. The nature of these proteins as homo-oligomers allows them to be readily built into higher-order structures such as nanocages, and the asymmetric pockets of these structures open rich possibilities for small-molecule binder design free from the constraints associated with monomer destabilization.",

        "abstract":"Molecular systems with coincident cyclic and superhelical symmetry axes have considerable advantages for materials design as they can be readily lengthened or shortened by changing the length of the constituent monomers. Among proteins, alpha-helical coiled coils have such symmetric, extendable architectures, but are limited by the relatively fixed geometry and flexibility of the helical protomers. Here we describe a systematic approach to generating modular and rigid repeat protein oligomers with coincident C 2  to C 8  and superhelical symmetry axes that can be readily extended by repeat propagation. From these building blocks, we demonstrate that a wide range of unbounded fibres can be systematically designed by introducing hydrophilic surface patches that force staggering of the monomers; the geometry of such fibres can be precisely tuned by varying the number of repeat units in the monomer and the placement of the hydrophilic patches.",

        "abstract":"Coiled-coil protein origami (CCPO) uses modular coiled-coil building blocks and topological principles to design polyhedral structures distinct from those of natural globular proteins. While the CCPO strategy has proven successful in designing diverse protein topologies, no high-resolution structural information has been available about these novel protein folds. Here we report the crystal structure of a single-chain CCPO in the shape of a triangle. While neither cyclization nor the addition of nanobodies enabled crystallization, it was ultimately facilitated by the inclusion of a GCN 2  homodimer. Triangle edges are formed by the orthogonal parallel coiled-coil dimers P1:P2, P3:P4, and GCN 2  connected by short linkers. A triangle has a large central cavity and is additionally stabilized by side-chain interactions between neighboring segments at each vertex. The crystal lattice is densely packed and stabilized by a large number of contacts between triangles. Interestingly, the polypeptide chain folds into a trefoil-type protein knot topology, and AlphaFold2 fails to predict the correct fold. The structure validates the modular CC-based protein design strategy, providing molecular insight underlying CCPO stabilization and new opportunities for the design.",

        "abstract":"Attaining molecular-level control over solidification processes is a crucial aspect of materials science. To control ice formation, organisms have evolved bewildering arrays of ice-binding proteins (IBPs), but these have poorly understood structure-activity relationships. We propose that reverse engineering using de novo computational protein design can shed light on structure-activity relationships of IBPs. We hypothesized that the model alpha-helical winter flounder antifreeze protein uses an unusual undertwisting of its alpha-helix to align its putative ice-binding threonine residues in exactly the same direction. We test this hypothesis by designing a series of straight three-helix bundles with an ice-binding helix projecting threonines and two supporting helices constraining the twist of the ice-binding helix. Our findings show that ice-recrystallization inhibition by the designed proteins increases with the degree of designed undertwisting, thus validating our hypothesis, and opening up avenues for the computational design of IBPs.",

Most existing models for de novo peptide design are largely based on sequence homology that can be restricted based on evolutionarily derived protein sequences and lack the physicochemical context essential in protein folding. Generative machine learning for de novo peptide design is a promising way to synthesize theoretical data that are based on, but unique from, the observable universe. In this study, we created and tested a custom peptide generative adversarial network intended to design peptide sequences that can fold into the \u03b2-hairpin secondary structure. This deep neural network model is designed to establish a preliminary foundation of the generative approach based on physicochemical and conformational properties of 20 canonical amino acids, for example, hydrophobicity and residue volume, using extant structure-specific sequence data from the PDB. The beta generative adversarial network model robustly distinguishes secondary structures of \u03b2 hairpin from \u03b1 helix and intrinsically disordered peptides with an accuracy of up to 96% and generates artificial \u03b2-hairpin peptide sequences with minimum sequence identities around 31% and 50% when compared against the current NCBI PDB and nonredundant databases, respectively. These results highlight the potential of generative models specifically anchored by physicochemical and conformational property features of amino acids to expand the sequence-to-structure landscape of proteins beyond evolutionary limits.",

The beta generative adversarial network model robustly distinguishes secondary structures of \u03b2 hairpin from \u03b1 helix and intrinsically disordered peptides with an accuracy of up to 96% and generates artificial \u03b2-hairpin peptide sequences with minimum sequence identities around 31% and 50% when compared against the current NCBI PDB and nonredundant databases, respectively. These results highlight the potential of generative models specifically anchored by physicochemical and conformational property features of amino acids to expand the sequence-to-structure landscape of proteins beyond evolutionary limits.",

        "abstract":"De novo peptide design is a new frontier that has broad application potential in the biological and biomedical fields. Most existing models for de novo peptide design are largely based on sequence homology that can be restricted based on evolutionarily derived protein sequences and lack the physicochemical context essential in protein folding. Generative machine learning for de novo peptide design is a promising way to synthesize theoretical data that are based on, but unique from, the observable universe. In this study, we created and tested a custom peptide generative adversarial network intended to design peptide sequences that can fold into the \u03b2-hairpin secondary structure. This deep neural network model is designed to establish a preliminary foundation of the generative approach based on physicochemical and conformational properties of 20 canonical amino acids, for example, hydrophobicity and residue volume, using extant structure-specific sequence data from the PDB.

        "abstract":"The assembly of the \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) to form oligomers and fibrils is closely associated with the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease. A\u03b2 is a shape-shifting peptide capable of adopting many conformations and folds within the multitude of oligomers and fibrils the peptide forms. These properties have precluded detailed structural elucidation and biological characterization of homogeneous, well-defined A\u03b2 oligomers. In this paper, we compare the structural, biophysical, and biological characteristics of two different covalently stabilized isomorphic trimers derived from the central and  C -terminal regions A\u03b2. X-ray crystallography reveals the structures of the trimers and shows that each trimer forms a ball-shaped dodecamer. Solution-phase and cell-based studies demonstrate that the two trimers exhibit markedly different assembly and biological properties. One trimer forms small soluble oligomers that enter cells through endocytosis and activate capase-3\/7-mediated apoptosis, while the other trimer forms large insoluble aggregates that accumulate on the outer plasma membrane and elicit cellular toxicity through an apoptosis-independent mechanism. The two trimers also exhibit different effects on the aggregation, toxicity, and cellular interaction of full-length A\u03b2, with one trimer showing a greater propensity to interact with A\u03b2 than the other. The studies described in this paper indicate that the two trimers share structural, biophysical, and biological characteristics with oligomers of full-length A\u03b2. The varying structural, assembly, and biological characteristics of the two trimers provide a working model for how different A\u03b2 trimers can assemble and lead to different biological effects, which may help shed light on the differences among A\u03b2 oligomers.",

        "abstract":"The assembly of the \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) to form oligomers and fibrils is closely associated with the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease. A\u03b2 is a shape-shifting peptide capable of adopting many conformations and folds within the multitude of oligomers and fibrils the peptide forms. These properties have precluded detailed structural elucidation and biological characterization of homogeneous, well-defined A\u03b2 oligomers. In this paper, we compare the structural, biophysical, and biological characteristics of two different covalently stabilized isomorphic trimers derived from the central and  C -terminal regions A\u03b2. X-ray crystallography reveals the structures of the trimers and shows that each trimer forms a ball-shaped dodecamer. Solution-phase and cell-based studies demonstrate that the two trimers exhibit markedly different assembly and biological properties. One trimer forms small soluble oligomers that enter cells through endocytosis and activate capase-3\/7-mediated apoptosis, while the other trimer forms large insoluble aggregates that accumulate on the outer plasma membrane and elicit cellular toxicity through an apoptosis-independent mechanism.

        "abstract":"Mimics of protein secondary and tertiary structure offer rationally-designed inhibitors of biomolecular interactions. \u03b2-Sheet mimics have a storied history in bioorganic chemistry and are typically designed with synthetic or natural turn segments. We hypothesized that replacement of terminal inter-\u03b2-strand hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) may lead to conformationally-defined macrocyclic \u03b2-sheets without the requirement for natural or synthetic \u03b2-turns, thereby providing a minimal mimic of a protein \u03b2-sheet. To access turn-less antiparallel \u03b2-sheet mimics, we developed a facile solid phase synthesis protocol. We surveyed a dataset of protein \u03b2-sheets for naturally observed interstrand side chain interactions. This bioinformatics survey highlighted an over-abundance of aromatic-aromatic, cation-\u03c0 and ionic interactions in \u03b2-sheets. In correspondence with natural \u03b2-sheets, we find that minimal HBS mimics show robust \u03b2-sheet formation when specific amino acid residue pairings are incorporated. In isolated \u03b2-sheets, aromatic interactions endow superior conformational stability over ionic or cation-\u03c0 interactions. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopies, along with high-resolution X-ray crystallography, support our design principles.",

We describe a \"top-down\" reinforcement learning-based design approach that solves this problem using Monte Carlo tree search to sample protein conformers in the context of an overall architecture and specified functional constraints. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the designed disk-shaped nanopores and ultracompact icosahedra are very close to the computational models. The icosohedra enable very-high-density display of immunogens and signaling molecules, which potentiates vaccine response and angiogenesis induction. Our approach enables the top-down design of complex protein nanomaterials with desired system properties and demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning in protein design.",

        "abstract":"Computationally designed multi-subunit assemblies have shown considerable promise for a variety of applications, including a new generation of potent vaccines. One of the major routes to such materials is rigid body sequence-independent docking of cyclic oligomers into architectures with point group or lattice symmetries. Current methods for docking and designing such assemblies are tailored to specific classes of symmetry and are difficult to modify for novel applications. Here we describe RPXDock, a fast, flexible, and modular software package for sequence-independent rigid-body protein docking across a wide range of symmetric architectures that is easily customizable for further development. RPXDock uses an efficient hierarchical search and a residue-pair transform (RPX) scoring method to rapidly search through multidimensional docking space. We describe the structure of the software, provide practical guidelines for its use, and describe the available functionalities including a variety of score functions and filtering tools that can be used to guide and refine docking results towards desired configurations.",

        "abstract":"An increasing number of protein interaction domains and their targets are being found to be intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The corresponding target recognition mechanisms are mostly elusive because of challenges in performing detailed structural analysis of highly dynamic IDP-IDP complexes. Here, we show that by combining recently developed computational approaches with experiments, the structure of the complex between the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of protein 4.1G and its target IDP region in NuMA can be dissected at high resolution. First, we carry out systematic mutational scanning using dihydrofolate reductase-based protein complementarity analysis to identify essential interaction regions and key residues. The results are found to be highly consistent with an \u03b1\/\u03b2-type complex structure predicted by AlphaFold2 (AF2). We then design mutants based on the predicted structure using a deep learning protein sequence design method. The solved crystal structure of one mutant presents the same core structure as predicted by AF2. Further computational prediction and experimental assessment indicate that the well-defined core structure is conserved across complexes of 4.1G CTD with other potential targets. Thus, we reveal that an intrinsically disordered protein interaction domain uses an \u03b1\/\u03b2-type structure module formed through synergistic folding to recognize broad IDP targets. Moreover, we show that computational prediction and experiment can be jointly applied to segregate true IDP regions from the core structural domains of IDP-IDP complexes and to uncover the structure-dependent mechanisms of some otherwise elusive IDP-IDP interactions.",

        "abstract":"General approaches for designing sequence-specific peptide-binding proteins would have wide utility in proteomics and synthetic biology. However, designing peptide-binding proteins is challenging, as most peptides do not have defined structures in isolation, and hydrogen bonds must be made to the buried polar groups in the peptide backbone 1-3 . Here, inspired by natural and re-engineered protein-peptide systems 4-11 , we set out to design proteins made out of repeating units that bind peptides with repeating sequences, with a one-to-one correspondence between the repeat units of the protein and those of the peptide. We use geometric hashing to identify protein backbones and peptide-docking arrangements that are compatible with bidentate hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the protein and the peptide backbone 12 . The remainder of the protein sequence is then optimized for folding and peptide binding. We design repeat proteins to bind to six different tripeptide-repeat sequences in polyproline II conformations. The proteins are hyperstable and bind to four to six tandem repeats of their tripeptide targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities in vitro and in living cells. Crystal structures reveal repeating interactions between protein and peptide interactions as designed, including ladders of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains to peptide backbones. By redesigning the binding interfaces of individual repeat units, specificity can be achieved for non-repeating peptide sequences and for disordered regions of native proteins.",

        "abstract":"The interleukin-4 (IL-4) cytokine plays a critical role in modulating immune homeostasis. Although there is great interest in harnessing this cytokine as a therapeutic in natural or engineered formats, the clinical potential of native IL-4 is limited by its instability and pleiotropic actions. Here, we design IL-4 cytokine mimetics (denoted Neo-4) based on a de novo engineered IL-2 mimetic scaffold and demonstrate that these cytokines can recapitulate physiological functions of IL-4 in cellular and animal models. In contrast with natural IL-4, Neo-4 is hyperstable and signals exclusively through the type I IL-4 receptor complex, providing previously inaccessible insights into differential IL-4 signaling through type I versus type II receptors. Because of their hyperstability, our computationally designed mimetics can directly incorporate into sophisticated biomaterials that require heat processing, such as three-dimensional-printed scaffolds. Neo-4 should be broadly useful for interrogating IL-4 biology, and the design workflow will inform targeted cytokine therapeutic development.",

However, designing peptide-binding proteins is challenging, as most peptides do not have defined structures in isolation, and hydrogen bonds must be made to the buried polar groups in the peptide backbone 1-3 . Here, inspired by natural and re-engineered protein-peptide systems 4-11 , we set out to design proteins made out of repeating units that bind peptides with repeating sequences, with a one-to-one correspondence between the repeat units of the protein and those of the peptide. We use geometric hashing to identify protein backbones and peptide-docking arrangements that are compatible with bidentate hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the protein and the peptide backbone 12 . The remainder of the protein sequence is then optimized for folding and peptide binding. We design repeat proteins to bind to six different tripeptide-repeat sequences in polyproline II conformations. The proteins are hyperstable and bind to four to six tandem repeats of their tripeptide targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities in vitro and in living cells. Crystal structures reveal repeating interactions between protein and peptide interactions as designed, including ladders of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains to peptide backbones. By redesigning the binding interfaces of individual repeat units, specificity can be achieved for non-repeating peptide sequences and for disordered regions of native proteins.",

        "abstract":"General approaches for designing sequence-specific peptide-binding proteins would have wide utility in proteomics and synthetic biology. However, designing peptide-binding proteins is challenging, as most peptides do not have defined structures in isolation, and hydrogen bonds must be made to the buried polar groups in the peptide backbone 1-3 . Here, inspired by natural and re-engineered protein-peptide systems 4-11 , we set out to design proteins made out of repeating units that bind peptides with repeating sequences, with a one-to-one correspondence between the repeat units of the protein and those of the peptide. We use geometric hashing to identify protein backbones and peptide-docking arrangements that are compatible with bidentate hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the protein and the peptide backbone 12 . The remainder of the protein sequence is then optimized for folding and peptide binding. We design repeat proteins to bind to six different tripeptide-repeat sequences in polyproline II conformations. The proteins are hyperstable and bind to four to six tandem repeats of their tripeptide targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities in vitro and in living cells. Crystal structures reveal repeating interactions between protein and peptide interactions as designed, including ladders of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains to peptide backbones. By redesigning the binding interfaces of individual repeat units, specificity can be achieved for non-repeating peptide sequences and for disordered regions of native proteins.",

        "abstract":"Small beta barrel proteins are attractive targets for computational design because of their considerable functional diversity despite their very small size (<70 amino acids). However, there are considerable challenges to designing such structures, and there has been little success thus far. Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta energy-based methods and deep learning approaches to design four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and oligonucleotide\/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful designs with high thermal stability and experimentally determined structures with less than 2.4 \u00c5 rmsd from the designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone. The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape space available for designing binders to protein targets of interest.",

        "abstract":"Small beta barrel proteins are attractive targets for computational design because of their considerable functional diversity despite their very small size (<70 amino acids). However, there are considerable challenges to designing such structures, and there has been little success thus far. Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta energy-based methods and deep learning approaches to design four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and oligonucleotide\/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful designs with high thermal stability and experimentally determined structures with less than 2.4 \u00c5 rmsd from the designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone. The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape space available for designing binders to protein targets of interest.",

        "abstract":"Computationally designed protein nanoparticles have recently emerged as a promising platform for the development of new vaccines and biologics. For many applications, secretion of designed nanoparticles from eukaryotic cells would be advantageous, but in practice, they often secrete poorly. Here we show that designed hydrophobic interfaces that drive nanoparticle assembly are often predicted to form cryptic transmembrane domains, suggesting that interaction with the membrane insertion machinery could limit efficient secretion. We develop a general computational protocol, the Degreaser, to design away cryptic transmembrane domains without sacrificing protein stability. The retroactive application of the Degreaser to previously designed nanoparticle components and nanoparticles considerably improves secretion, and modular integration of the Degreaser into design pipelines results in new nanoparticles that secrete as robustly as naturally occurring protein assemblies. Both the Degreaser protocol and the nanoparticles we describe may be broadly useful in biotechnological applications.",

        "abstract":"Computationally designed protein nanoparticles have recently emerged as a promising platform for the development of new vaccines and biologics. For many applications, secretion of designed nanoparticles from eukaryotic cells would be advantageous, but in practice, they often secrete poorly. Here we show that designed hydrophobic interfaces that drive nanoparticle assembly are often predicted to form cryptic transmembrane domains, suggesting that interaction with the membrane insertion machinery could limit efficient secretion. We develop a general computational protocol, the Degreaser, to design away cryptic transmembrane domains without sacrificing protein stability. The retroactive application of the Degreaser to previously designed nanoparticle components and nanoparticles considerably improves secretion, and modular integration of the Degreaser into design pipelines results in new nanoparticles that secrete as robustly as naturally occurring protein assemblies. Both the Degreaser protocol and the nanoparticles we describe may be broadly useful in biotechnological applications.",

        "abstract":"The ability to finely control the structure of protein folds is an important prerequisite to functional protein design. The TIM barrel fold is an important target for these efforts as it is highly enriched for diverse functions in nature. Although a TIM barrel protein has been designed de novo, the ability to finely alter the curvature of the central beta barrel and the overall architecture of the fold remains elusive, limiting its utility for functional design. Here, we report the de novo design of a TIM barrel with ovoid (twofold) symmetry, drawing inspiration from natural beta and TIM barrels with ovoid curvature. We use an autoregressive backbone sampling strategy to implement our hypothesis for elongated barrel curvature, followed by an iterative enrichment sequence design protocol to obtain sequences which yield a high proportion of successfully folding designs. Designed sequences are highly stable and fold to the designed barrel curvature as determined by a 2.1\u2009\u00c5 resolution crystal structure. The designs show robustness to drastic mutations, retaining high melting temperatures even when multiple charged residues are buried in the hydrophobic core or when the hydrophobic core is ablated to alanine. As a scaffold with a greater capacity for hosting diverse hydrogen bonding networks and installation of binding pockets or active sites, the ovoid TIM barrel represents a major step towards the de novo design of functional TIM barrels.",

        "abstract":"Protein nanocages are of increasing interest for use as drug capsules, but the encapsulation and release of drug molecules at appropriate times require the reversible association and dissociation of the nanocages. One promising approach to addressing this challenge is the design of metal-dependent associating proteins. Such designed proteins typically have Cys or His residues at the protein surface for connecting the associating proteins through metal-ion coordination. However, Cys and His residues favor interactions with soft and borderline metal ions, such as Au +  and Zn 2+ , classified by the hard and soft acids and bases concept, restricting the types of metal ions available to drive association. Here, we show the alkaline earth (AE) metal-dependent association of the recently designed artificial protein nanocage TIP60, which is composed of 60-mer fusion proteins. The introduction of a Glu (hard base) mutation to the fusion protein (K67E mutant) prevented the formation of the 60-mer but formed the expected cage structure in the presence of Ca, Sr, or Ba ions (hard acids). Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis indicated a Ba ion at the interface of the subunits. Furthermore, we demonstrated the encapsulation and release of single-stranded DNA molecules using this system. Our results provide insights into the design of AE metal-dependent association and dissociation mechanisms for proteins.",

To investigate the three-dimensional structure of the hydrophobic leucinostatin derivative ZHAWOC6027, the previously developed host lattice display technology was applied. Two designed ankyrin-repeat proteins (DARPins) recognizing a biotinylated ZHAWOC6027 derivative were selected from a diverse library by ribosome display under aqueous buffer conditions.

Using a high mutation frequency, the method can determine mutations that increase the stability of even very stable proteins for which conventional selection systems have reached their limit. As a demonstration of this, we screened a mutant library of a highly stable and computationally redesigned model protein using an  in\u00a0vivo  genetic sensor for folding and assigned a stability effect to 374 of 912 possible single amino acid substitutions. Combining the top 9 substitutions increased the unfolding energy 47 to 69\u00a0kJ\/mol in a single engineering step. Crystal structures of stabilized variants showed small perturbations in helices 1 and 2, which rendered them closer in structure to the redesign template. This case study illustrates the capability of the method, which is applicable to any screen for protein function.",

        "abstract":"We apply a computational model, global multi-mutant analysis (GMMA), to inform on effects of most amino acid substitutions from a randomly mutated gene library. Using a high mutation frequency, the method can determine mutations that increase the stability of even very stable proteins for which conventional selection systems have reached their limit. As a demonstration of this, we screened a mutant library of a highly stable and computationally redesigned model protein using an  in\u00a0vivo  genetic sensor for folding and assigned a stability effect to 374 of 912 possible single amino acid substitutions. Combining the top 9 substitutions increased the unfolding energy 47 to 69\u00a0kJ\/mol in a single engineering step. Crystal structures of stabilized variants showed small perturbations in helices 1 and 2, which rendered them closer in structure to the redesign template. This case study illustrates the capability of the method, which is applicable to any screen for protein function.",

        "abstract":"De novo protein design methods can create proteins with folds not yet seen in nature. These methods largely focus on optimizing the compatibility between the designed sequence and the intended conformation, without explicit consideration of protein folding pathways. Deeply knotted proteins, whose topologies may introduce substantial barriers to folding, thus represent an interesting test case for protein design. Here we report our attempts to design proteins with trefoil (3 1 ) and pentafoil (5 1 ) knotted topologies. We extended previously described algorithms for tandem repeat protein design in order to construct deeply knotted backbones and matching designed repeat sequences (N\u2009=\u20093 repeats for the trefoil and N\u2009=\u20095 for the pentafoil). We confirmed the intended conformation for the trefoil design by X ray crystallography, and we report here on this protein's structure, stability, and folding behaviour. The pentafoil design misfolded into an asymmetric structure (despite a 5-fold symmetric sequence); two of the four repeat-repeat units matched the designed backbone while the other two diverged to form local contacts, leading to a trefoil rather than pentafoil knotted topology. Our results also provide insights into the folding of knotted proteins.",

        "abstract":"The design of completely synthetic proteins from first principles- de novo  protein design-is challenging. This is because, despite recent advances in computational protein-structure prediction and design, we do not understand fully the sequence-to-structure relationships for protein folding, assembly, and stabilization. Antiparallel 4-helix bundles are amongst the most studied scaffolds for  de novo  protein design. We set out to re-examine this target, and to determine clear sequence-to-structure relationships, or design rules, for the structure. Our aim was to determine a common and robust sequence background for designing multiple  de novo  4-helix bundles. In turn, this could be used in chemical and synthetic biology to direct protein-protein interactions and as scaffolds for functional protein design. Our approach starts by analyzing known antiparallel 4-helix coiled-coil structures to deduce design rules. In terms of the heptad repeat,   abcdefg   - i.e. , the sequence signature of many helical bundles-the key features that we identify are:   a   = Leu,   d   = Ile,   e   = Ala,   g   = Gln, and the use of complementary charged residues at b and c. Next, we implement these rules in the rational design of synthetic peptides to form antiparallel homo- and heterotetramers. Finally, we use the sequence of the homotetramer to derive in one step a single-chain 4-helix-bundle protein for recombinant production in  E. coli . All of the assembled designs are confirmed in aqueous solution using biophysical methods, and ultimately by determining high-resolution X-ray crystal structures. Our route from peptides to proteins provides an understanding of the role of each residue in each design.",

Here, we describe a deep learning-based protein sequence design method, ProteinMPNN, that has outstanding performance in both in silico and experimental tests. On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4% compared with 32.9% for Rosetta. The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges. We demonstrate the broad utility and high accuracy of ProteinMPNN using x-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and functional studies by rescuing previously failed designs, which were made using Rosetta or AlphaFold, of protein monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, tetrahedral nanoparticles, and target-binding proteins.",

        "abstract":"The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-binding integrins \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 are clinically validated cancer and fibrosis targets of considerable therapeutic importance. Compounds that can discriminate between homologous \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 and other RGD integrins, stabilize specific conformational states, and have high thermal stability could have considerable therapeutic utility. Existing small molecule and antibody inhibitors do not have all these properties, and hence\u00a0new approaches are needed. Here we describe a generalized method for computationally designing RGD-containing miniproteins selective for a single RGD integrin heterodimer and conformational state. We design hyperstable, selective \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 inhibitors that bind with picomolar affinity. CryoEM structures of the designed inhibitor-integrin complexes are very\u00a0close to the computational design models,\u00a0and\u00a0show\u00a0that the inhibitors stabilize specific conformational states of the\u00a0\u03b1v\u03b26 and the \u03b1v\u03b28 integrins. In a lung fibrosis mouse model, the \u03b1v\u03b26 inhibitor potently reduced fibrotic burden and improved overall lung mechanics, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of de novo designed integrin binding proteins with high selectivity.",

        "abstract":"The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-binding integrins \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 are clinically validated cancer and fibrosis targets of considerable therapeutic importance. Compounds that can discriminate between homologous \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 and other RGD integrins, stabilize specific conformational states, and have high thermal stability could have considerable therapeutic utility. Existing small molecule and antibody inhibitors do not have all these properties, and hence\u00a0new approaches are needed. Here we describe a generalized method for computationally designing RGD-containing miniproteins selective for a single RGD integrin heterodimer and conformational state. We design hyperstable, selective \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 inhibitors that bind with picomolar affinity. CryoEM structures of the designed inhibitor-integrin complexes are very\u00a0close to the computational design models,\u00a0and\u00a0show\u00a0that the inhibitors stabilize specific conformational states of the\u00a0\u03b1v\u03b26 and the \u03b1v\u03b28 integrins. In a lung fibrosis mouse model, the \u03b1v\u03b26 inhibitor potently reduced fibrotic burden and improved overall lung mechanics, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of de novo designed integrin binding proteins with high selectivity.",

Here, we describe deep learning approaches for scaffolding such functional sites without needing to prespecify the fold or secondary structure of the scaffold. The first approach, \"constrained hallucination,\" optimizes sequences such that their predicted structures contain the desired functional site. The second approach, \"inpainting,\" starts from the functional site and fills in additional sequence and structure to create a viable protein scaffold in a single forward pass through a specifically trained RoseTTAFold network. We use these two methods to design candidate immunogens, receptor traps, metalloproteins, enzymes, and protein-binding proteins and validate the designs using a combination of in silico and experimental tests.",

For design of binding to symmetric ligands, protein homo-oligomers with matching symmetry are advantageous as each protein subunit can make identical interactions with the ligand. Here, we describe a general approach to designing hyperstable C2 symmetric proteins with pockets of diverse size and shape. We first designed repeat proteins that sample a continuum of curvatures but have low helical rise, then docked these into C2 symmetric homodimers to generate an extensive range of C2 symmetric cavities. We used this approach to design thousands of C2 symmetric homodimers, and characterized 101 of them experimentally. Of these, the geometry of 31 were confirmed by small angle X-ray scattering and 2 were shown by crystallographic analyses to be in close agreement with the computational design models.

Furthermore, small structural variations in a single fold, sometimes only a few amino acids, can define a protein's molecular function. Hence, to design proteins with novel functionalities, such as molecular recognition, methods to control and sample shape diversity are necessary. To explore this space, we developed and experimentally validated a computational platform that can design a wide variety of small protein folds while sampling shape diversity. We designed and evaluated stability of about 30,000 de novo protein designs of eight different folds. Among these designs, about 6,200 stable proteins were identified, including some predicted to have a first-of-its-kind minimalized thioredoxin fold. Obtained data revealed protein folding rules\u00a0for structural features such as helix-connecting loops. Beyond serving as a resource for protein engineering, this massive and diverse dataset also provides training data for machine learning. We developed an accurate classifier to predict the stability of our designed proteins. The methods and the wide range of protein shapes provide a basis for designing new protein functions without compromising stability.",

In place of hundreds of complex, membrane-bound G-protein coupled receptors, differential sensors employ arrays of small molecules. Here we show that arrays of computationally designed de novo peptides provide alternative synthetic receptors for differential sensing. We use self-assembling \u03b1-helical barrels (\u03b1HBs) with central channels that can be altered predictably to vary their sizes, shapes and chemistries. The channels accommodate environment-sensitive dyes that fluoresce upon binding. Challenging arrays of dye-loaded barrels with analytes causes differential fluorophore displacement. The resulting fluorimetric fingerprints are used to train machine-learning models that relate the patterns to the analytes. We show that this system discriminates between a range of biomolecules, drink, and diagnostically relevant biological samples. As \u03b1HBs are robust and chemically diverse, the system has potential to sense many analytes in various settings.",

        "abstract":"Function follows form in biology, and the binding of small molecules requires proteins with pockets that match the shape of the ligand. For design of binding to symmetric ligands, protein homo-oligomers with matching symmetry are advantageous as each protein subunit can make identical interactions with the ligand. Here, we describe a general approach to designing hyperstable C2 symmetric proteins with pockets of diverse size and shape. We first designed repeat proteins that sample a continuum of curvatures but have low helical rise, then docked these into C2 symmetric homodimers to generate an extensive range of C2 symmetric cavities. We used this approach to design thousands of C2 symmetric homodimers, and characterized 101 of them experimentally. Of these, the geometry of 31 were confirmed by small angle X-ray scattering and 2 were shown by crystallographic analyses to be in close agreement with the computational design models. These scaffolds provide a rich set of starting points for binding a wide range of C2 symmetric compounds.",

        "abstract":"The design of proteins that bind to a specific site on the surface of a target protein using no information other than the three-dimensional structure of the target remains a challenge 1-5 . Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted design of binders to sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",

Although other helical peptide conformations do exist near to the \u03b1-helical region of conformational space-namely, 3 10 -helices and \u03c0-helices 5 -these occur much less frequently in protein structures. Less favourable internal energies and reduced tendencies to pack into higher-order structures mean that 3 10 -helices rarely exceed six residues in length in natural proteins, and that they tend not to form normal supersecondary, tertiary or quaternary interactions. Here we show that despite their absence in nature, synthetic peptide assemblies can be built from 3 10 -helices. We report the rational design, solution-phase characterization and an X-ray crystal structure for water-soluble bundles of 3 10 -helices with consolidated hydrophobic cores. The design uses six-residue repeats informed by analysing 3 10 -helical conformations in known protein structures, and incorporates \u03b1-aminoisobutyric acid residues. Design iterations reveal a tipping point between \u03b1-helical and 3 10 -helical folding, and identify features required for stabilizing assemblies of 3 10 -helices. This work provides principles and rules to open opportunities for designing into this hitherto unexplored region of protein-structure space.",

Although other helical peptide conformations do exist near to the \u03b1-helical region of conformational space-namely, 3 10 -helices and \u03c0-helices 5 -these occur much less frequently in protein structures. Less favourable internal energies and reduced tendencies to pack into higher-order structures mean that 3 10 -helices rarely exceed six residues in length in natural proteins, and that they tend not to form normal supersecondary, tertiary or quaternary interactions. Here we show that despite their absence in nature, synthetic peptide assemblies can be built from 3 10 -helices. We report the rational design, solution-phase characterization and an X-ray crystal structure for water-soluble bundles of 3 10 -helices with consolidated hydrophobic cores. The design uses six-residue repeats informed by analysing 3 10 -helical conformations in known protein structures, and incorporates \u03b1-aminoisobutyric acid residues. Design iterations reveal a tipping point between \u03b1-helical and 3 10 -helical folding, and identify features required for stabilizing assemblies of 3 10 -helices.

        "abstract":"The design of proteins that bind to a specific site on the surface of a target protein using no information other than the three-dimensional structure of the target remains a challenge 1-5 . Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted design of binders to sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",

        "abstract":"Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a pattern recognition receptor critical for the innate immune response to intracellular pathogens, DNA damage, tumorigenesis and senescence. Binding to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) induces conformational changes in cGAS that activate the enzyme to produce 2'-3' cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a second messenger that initiates a potent interferon (IFN) response through its receptor, STING. Here, we combined two-state computational design with informatics-guided design to create constitutively active, dsDNA ligand-independent cGAS (CA-cGAS). We identified CA-cGAS mutants with IFN-stimulating activity approaching that of dsDNA-stimulated wild-type cGAS. DNA-independent adoption of the active conformation was directly confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In vivo expression of CA-cGAS in tumor cells resulted in STING-dependent tumor regression, demonstrating that the designed proteins have therapeutically relevant biological activity. Our work provides a general framework for stabilizing active conformations of enzymes and provides CA-cGAS variants that could be useful as genetically encoded adjuvants and tools for understanding inflammatory diseases.",

Here, we investigate the capability of a deep neural network model to automate design of sequences onto protein backbones, having learned directly from crystal structure data and without any human-specified priors. The model generalizes to native topologies not seen during training, producing experimentally stable designs. We evaluate the generalizability of our method to a de novo TIM-barrel scaffold. The model produces novel sequences, and high-resolution crystal structures of two designs show excellent agreement with in silico models. Our findings demonstrate the tractability of an entirely learned method for protein sequence design.",

In place of hundreds of complex, membrane-bound G-protein coupled receptors, differential sensors employ arrays of small molecules. Here we show that arrays of computationally designed de novo peptides provide alternative synthetic receptors for differential sensing. We use self-assembling \u03b1-helical barrels (\u03b1HBs) with central channels that can be altered predictably to vary their sizes, shapes and chemistries. The channels accommodate environment-sensitive dyes that fluoresce upon binding. Challenging arrays of dye-loaded barrels with analytes causes differential fluorophore displacement. The resulting fluorimetric fingerprints are used to train machine-learning models that relate the patterns to the analytes. We show that this system discriminates between a range of biomolecules, drink, and diagnostically relevant biological samples. As \u03b1HBs are robust and chemically diverse, the system has potential to sense many analytes in various settings.",

        "abstract":"Understanding protein folding is crucial for protein sciences. The conformational spaces and energy landscapes of cold (unfolded) protein states, as well as the associated transitions, are hardly explored. Furthermore, it is not known how structure relates to the cooperativity of cold transitions, if cold and heat unfolded states are thermodynamically similar, and if cold states play important roles for protein function. We created the cold unfolding 4-helix bundle DCUB1 with a de novo designed bipartite hydrophilic\/hydrophobic core featuring a hydrogen bond network which extends across the bundle in order to study the relative importance of hydrophobic versus hydrophilic protein-water interactions for cold unfolding. Structural and thermodynamic characterization resulted in the discovery of a complex energy landscape for cold transitions, while the heat unfolded state is a random coil. Below \u223c0 \u00b0C, the core of DCUB1 disintegrates in a largely cooperative manner, while a near-native helical content is retained. The resulting cold core-unfolded state is compact and features extensive internal dynamics. Below -5 \u00b0C, two additional cold transitions are seen, that is, (i) the formation of a water-mediated, compact, and highly dynamic dimer, and (ii) the onset of cold helix unfolding decoupled from cold core unfolding. Our results suggest that cold unfolding is initiated by the intrusion of water into the hydrophilic core network and that cooperativity can be tuned by varying the number of core hydrogen bond networks. Protein design has proven to be invaluable to explore the energy landscapes of cold states and to robustly test related theories.",

We use implicit negative design to generate \u03b2 sheet-mediated heterodimers that can be assembled into a wide variety of complexes. The designs are stable, folded, and soluble in isolation and rapidly assemble upon mixing, and crystal structures are close to the computational models. We construct linearly arranged hetero-oligomers with up to six different components, branched hetero-oligomers, closed C4-symmetric two-component rings, and hetero-oligomers assembled on a cyclic homo-oligomeric central hub and demonstrate that such complexes can readily reconfigure through subunit exchange.

We generate random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting residue-residue distance maps, which, as expected, are quite featureless. We then carry out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence space, optimizing the contrast (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the inter-residue\u00a0distance distributions predicted by the network and background distributions averaged over all proteins. Optimization from different random starting points resulted in novel proteins spanning a wide range of sequences and predicted structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding 129 of the network-'hallucinated' sequences, and expressed and purified the proteins in Escherichia coli; 27 of the proteins yielded monodisperse species with circular dichroism spectra consistent with the hallucinated structures. We determined the three-dimensional\u00a0structures of three of the hallucinated proteins, two by X-ray crystallography and one by NMR, and these closely matched the hallucinated models.

        "abstract":"Engineered proteins generally must possess a stable structure in order to achieve their designed function. Stable designs, however, are astronomically rare within the space of all possible amino acid sequences. As a consequence, many designs must be tested computationally and experimentally in order to find stable ones, which is expensive in terms of time and resources. Here we use a high-throughput, low-fidelity assay to experimentally evaluate the stability of approximately 200,000 novel proteins. These include a wide range of sequence perturbations, providing a baseline for future work in the field. We build a neural network model that predicts protein stability given only sequences of amino acids, and compare its performance to the assayed values. We also report another network model that is able to generate the amino acid sequences of novel stable proteins given requested secondary sequences. Finally, we show that the predictive model-despite weaknesses including a noisy data set-can be used to substantially increase the stability of both expert-designed and model-generated proteins.",

        "abstract":"There has been considerable recent progress in protein structure prediction using deep neural networks to predict inter-residue distances from amino acid sequences 1-3 . Here we investigate whether the information captured by such networks is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occurring proteins used in training the models. We generate random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting residue-residue distance maps, which, as expected, are quite featureless. We then carry out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence space, optimizing the contrast (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the inter-residue\u00a0distance distributions predicted by the network and background distributions averaged over all proteins. Optimization from different random starting points resulted in novel proteins spanning a wide range of sequences and predicted structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding 129 of the network-'hallucinated' sequences, and expressed and purified the proteins in Escherichia coli; 27 of the proteins yielded monodisperse species with circular dichroism spectra consistent with the hallucinated structures. We determined the three-dimensional\u00a0structures of three of the hallucinated proteins, two by X-ray crystallography and one by NMR, and these closely matched the hallucinated models. Thus, deep networks trained to predict native protein structures from their sequences can be inverted to design new proteins, and such networks and methods should contribute alongside traditional physics-based models to the de novo design of proteins with new functions.",

        "abstract":"A protein backbone structure is designable if a substantial number of amino acid sequences exist that autonomously fold into it 1,2 . It has been suggested that the designability of backbones is governed mainly by side chain-independent or side chain type-insensitive molecular interactions 3-5 , indicating an approach for designing new backbones (ready for amino acid selection) based on continuous sampling and optimization of the backbone-centred energy surface. However, a sufficiently comprehensive and precise energy function has yet to be established for this purpose. Here we show that this goal is met by a statistical model named SCUBA (for Side Chain-Unknown Backbone Arrangement) that uses neural network-form energy terms. These terms are learned with a two-step approach that comprises kernel density estimation followed by neural network training and can analytically represent multidimensional, high-order correlations in known protein structures. We report the crystal structures of nine de novo proteins whose backbones were designed to high precision using SCUBA, four of which have novel, non-natural overall architectures. By eschewing use of fragments from existing protein structures, SCUBA-driven structure design facilitates far-reaching exploration of the designable backbone space, thus extending the novelty and diversity of the proteins amenable to de novo design.",

        "abstract":"The V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein elicits a vigorous, but largely non-neutralizing antibody response directed to the V3-crown, whereas rare broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) target the V3-base. Challenging this view, we present V3-crown directed broadly neutralizing Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (bnDs) matching the breadth of V3-base bnAbs. While most bnAbs target prefusion Env, V3-crown bnDs bind open Env conformations triggered by CD4 engagement. BnDs achieve breadth by focusing on highly conserved residues that are accessible in two distinct V3 conformations, one of which resembles CCR5-bound V3. We further show that these V3-crown conformations can, in principle, be attacked by antibodies. Supporting this conclusion, analysis of antibody binding activity in the Swiss 4.5\u2009K HIV-1 cohort (n\u2009=\u20094,281) revealed a co-evolution of V3-crown reactivities and neutralization breadth. Our results indicate a role of V3-crown responses and its conformational preferences in bnAb development to be considered in preventive and therapeutic approaches.",

We use implicit negative design to generate \u03b2 sheet-mediated heterodimers that can be assembled into a wide variety of complexes. The designs are stable, folded, and soluble in isolation and rapidly assemble upon mixing, and crystal structures are close to the computational models. We construct linearly arranged hetero-oligomers with up to six different components, branched hetero-oligomers, closed C4-symmetric two-component rings, and hetero-oligomers assembled on a cyclic homo-oligomeric central hub and demonstrate that such complexes can readily reconfigure through subunit exchange. Our approach provides a general route to designing asymmetric reconfigurable protein systems.",

Here, we report the characterization and structure of a de novo diheme \"maquette\" protein, 4D2, which we subsequently use to create an expanded, modular platform for heme protein design. A well-folded monoheme variant was created by computational redesign, which was then utilized for the experimental validation of continuum electrostatic redox potential calculations. This demonstrates how fundamental biophysical properties can be predicted and fine-tuned. 4D2 was then extended into a tetraheme helical bundle, representing a 7 nm molecular wire. Despite a molecular weight of only 24 kDa, electron cryomicroscopy illustrated a remarkable level of detail, indicating the positioning of the secondary structure and the heme cofactors. This robust, expressible, highly thermostable and readily designable modular platform presents a valuable resource for redox protein design and the future construction of artificial electron-conducting circuitry.",

De novo protein design can readily address these challenges. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a topological refactoring strategy to design novel granulopoietic proteins starting from the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) structure. We change a protein fold by rearranging the sequence and optimising it towards the new fold. Testing four designs, we obtain two that possess nanomolar activity, the most active of which is highly thermostable and protease-resistant, and matches its designed structure to atomic accuracy. While the designs possess starkly different sequence and structure from the native G-CSF, they show specific activity in differentiating primary human haematopoietic stem cells into mature neutrophils. The designs also show significant and specific activity in vivo. Our topological refactoring approach is largely independent of sequence or structural context, and is therefore applicable to a wide range of protein targets.",

So far, 4- to 12-bladed [Formula: see text]-propellers have been discovered in nature showing large functional and sequential variation. Using computational design approaches, we created perfectly symmetric [Formula: see text]-propellers out of natural pseudo-symmetric templates. These proteins are useful tools to study protein evolution of this very diverse fold. While the 7-bladed architecture is the most common, no symmetric 7-bladed monomer has been created and characterized so far.

Recently, we developed a uniform supramolecular protein nanoparticle, TIP60, symmmetrically self-assembled from fusion proteins of a pentameric Sm-like protein and a dimeric MyoX-coil domain. Herein, we report the icosahedral 60-meric structure of TIP60 solved using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Interestingly, the structure revealed 20 regular-triangle-like pores on the surface. TIP60 and its mutants have many modifiable sites on their exterior and interior surfaces. The TIP60 architecture will be useful in the development of biomedical and biochemical nanoparticles\/nanocages for future applications.",

        "abstract":"While the application of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to helical polymers in biology has a long history, due to the huge number of helical macromolecular assemblies in viruses, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, the use of cryo-EM to study synthetic soft matter noncovalent polymers has been much more limited. This has mainly been due to the lack of familiarity with cryo-EM in the materials science and chemistry communities, in contrast to the fact that cryo-EM was developed as a biological technique. Nevertheless, the relatively few structures of self-assembled peptide nanotubes and ribbons solved at near-atomic resolution by cryo-EM have demonstrated that cryo-EM should be the method of choice for a structural analysis of synthetic helical filaments. In addition, cryo-EM has also demonstrated that the self-assembly of soft matter polymers has enormous potential for polymorphism, something that may be obscured by techniques such as scattering and spectroscopy. These cryo-EM structures have revealed how far we currently are from being able to predict the structure of these polymers due to their chaotic self-assembly behavior.",

        "abstract":"Although \u03b2-hairpins are widespread in proteins, there is no tool to coax any small peptide to adopt a \u03b2-hairpin conformation, regardless of sequence. Here, we report that \u03b4-linked \u03b3(R)-methyl-ornithine ( \u03b4  MeOrn) provides an improved \u03b2-turn template for inducing a \u03b2-hairpin conformation in peptides. We developed a synthesis of protected  \u03b4  MeOrn as a building block suitable for use in Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis. The synthesis begins with l-leucine and affords gram quantities of the N \u03b1  -Boc-N \u03b4  -Fmoc-\u03b3(R)-methyl-ornithine building block. X-ray crystallography confirms that the  \u03b4  MeOrn turn unit adopts a folded structure in a macrocyclic \u03b2-hairpin peptide. CD and NMR spectroscopy allow comparison of the  \u03b4  MeOrn turn template to the \u03b4-linked ornithine ( \u03b4  Orn) turn template that we previously introduced and to the popular d-Pro-Gly turn template. These studies show that the folding of the  \u03b4  MeOrn turn template is substantially better than that of  \u03b4  Orn and is comparable to d-Pro-Gly.",

        "abstract":"The ability to design stable proteins with custom-made functions is a major goal in biochemistry with practical relevance for our environment and society. Understanding and manipulating protein stability provide crucial information on the molecular determinants that modulate structure and stability, and expand the applications of de novo proteins. Since the (\u03b2\/\u237a) 8 -barrel or TIM-barrel fold is one of the most common functional scaffolds, in this work we designed a collection of stable de novo TIM barrels (DeNovoTIMs), using a computational fixed-backbone and modular approach based on improved hydrophobic packing of sTIM11, the first validated de novo TIM barrel, and subjected them to a thorough folding analysis. DeNovoTIMs navigate a region of the stability landscape previously uncharted by natural TIM barrels, with variations spanning 60 degrees in melting temperature and 22\u00a0kcal per mol in conformational stability throughout the designs. Significant non-additive or epistatic effects were observed when stabilizing mutations from different regions of the barrel were combined. The molecular basis of epistasis in DeNovoTIMs appears to be related to the extension of the hydrophobic cores. This study is an important step towards the fine-tuned modulation of protein stability by design.",

Understanding and manipulating protein stability provide crucial information on the molecular determinants that modulate structure and stability, and expand the applications of de novo proteins. Since the (\u03b2\/\u237a) 8 -barrel or TIM-barrel fold is one of the most common functional scaffolds, in this work we designed a collection of stable de novo TIM barrels (DeNovoTIMs), using a computational fixed-backbone and modular approach based on improved hydrophobic packing of sTIM11, the first validated de novo TIM barrel, and subjected them to a thorough folding analysis. DeNovoTIMs navigate a region of the stability landscape previously uncharted by natural TIM barrels, with variations spanning 60 degrees in melting temperature and 22\u00a0kcal per mol in conformational stability throughout the designs. Significant non-additive or epistatic effects were observed when stabilizing mutations from different regions of the barrel were combined. The molecular basis of epistasis in DeNovoTIMs appears to be related to the extension of the hydrophobic cores. This study is an important step towards the fine-tuned modulation of protein stability by design.",

A ninefold-symmetric \u03b2-propeller protein named Cake has recently been developed. Here, attempts were made to further engineer this protein into a threefold-symmetric nine-bladed propeller using computational design. Two nine-bladed propeller proteins were designed, named Scone-E and Scone-R. Crystallography, however, revealed the structure of both designs to adopt an eightfold conformation with distorted termini, leading to a pseudo-symmetric protein. One of the proteins could only be crystallized upon the addition of a polyoxometalate, highlighting the usefulness of these molecules as crystallization additives.",

        "abstract":"A systematic and robust approach to generating complex protein nanomaterials would have broad utility. We develop a hierarchical approach to designing multi-component protein assemblies from two classes of modular building blocks: designed helical repeat proteins (DHRs) and helical bundle oligomers (HBs). We first rigidly fuse DHRs to HBs to generate a large library of oligomeric building blocks. We then generate assemblies with cyclic, dihedral, and point group symmetries from these building blocks using architecture guided rigid helical fusion with new software named WORMS. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy characterization show that the hierarchical design approach can accurately generate a wide range of assemblies, including a 43\u2009nm diameter icosahedral nanocage. The computational methods and building block sets described here provide a very general route to de novo designed protein nanomaterials.",

        "abstract":"A systematic and robust approach to generating complex protein nanomaterials would have broad utility. We develop a hierarchical approach to designing multi-component protein assemblies from two classes of modular building blocks: designed helical repeat proteins (DHRs) and helical bundle oligomers (HBs). We first rigidly fuse DHRs to HBs to generate a large library of oligomeric building blocks. We then generate assemblies with cyclic, dihedral, and point group symmetries from these building blocks using architecture guided rigid helical fusion with new software named WORMS. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy characterization show that the hierarchical design approach can accurately generate a wide range of assemblies, including a 43\u2009nm diameter icosahedral nanocage. The computational methods and building block sets described here provide a very general route to de novo designed protein nanomaterials.",

        "abstract":"The rational design of linear peptides that assemble controllably and predictably in water is challenging. Short sequences must encode unique target structures and avoid alternative states. However, the non-covalent forces that stabilize and discriminate between states are weak. Nonetheless, for \u03b1-helical coiled-coil assemblies considerable progress has been made in rational  de novo  design. In these, sequence repeats of nominally hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) residues,  hpphppp , direct the assembly of amphipathic helices into dimeric to tetrameric bundles. Expanding this pattern to  hpphhph  can produce larger \u03b1-helical barrels. Here, we show that pentameric to nonameric barrels are accessed by varying the residue at one of the  h  sites. In peptides with four L\/I-K-E-I-A-x-Z repeats, decreasing the size of Z from threonine to serine to alanine to glycine gives progressively larger oligomers. X-ray crystal structures of the resulting \u03b1-helical barrels rationalize this: side chains at Z point directly into the helical interfaces, and smaller residues allow closer helix contacts and larger assemblies.",

        "abstract":"Rational protein design requires understanding the contribution of each amino acid to a targeted protein fold. For a subset of protein structures, namely, \u03b1-helical coiled coils (CCs), knowledge is sufficiently advanced to allow the rational  de novo  design of many structures, including entirely new protein folds. Current CC design rules center on using aliphatic hydrophobic residues predominantly to drive the folding and assembly of amphipathic \u03b1 helices. The consequences of using aromatic residues-which would be useful for introducing structural probes, and binding and catalytic functionalities-into these interfaces are not understood. There are specific examples of designed CCs containing such aromatic residues,  e.g ., phenylalanine-rich sequences, and the use of polar aromatic residues to make buried hydrogen-bond networks. However, it is not known generally if sequences rich in tyrosine can form CCs, or what CC assemblies these would lead to. Here, we explore tyrosine-rich sequences in a general CC-forming background and resolve new CC structures. In one of these, an antiparallel tetramer, the tyrosine residues are solvent accessible and pack at the interface between the core and the surface. In another more complex structure, the residues are buried and form an extended hydrogen-bond network.",

Here we show that design and directed evolution can be used to transform a non-natural, functionally naive zinc-binding protein into a highly active catalyst for an abiological hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. The artificial metalloenzyme achieves >10 4  turnovers per active site, exerts absolute control over reaction pathway and product stereochemistry, and displays a catalytic proficiency (1\/K TS \u2009=\u20092.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910 10 \u2009M -1 ) that exceeds all previously characterized Diels-Alderases. These properties capitalize on effective Lewis acid catalysis, a chemical strategy for accelerating Diels-Alder reactions common in the laboratory but so far unknown in nature. Extension of this approach to other metal ions and other de novo scaffolds may propel the design field in exciting new directions.",

These properties capitalize on effective Lewis acid catalysis, a chemical strategy for accelerating Diels-Alder reactions common in the laboratory but so far unknown in nature. Extension of this approach to other metal ions and other de novo scaffolds may propel the design field in exciting new directions.",

        "abstract":"The design of peptides that assemble in membranes to form functional ion channels is challenging. Specifically, hydrophobic interactions must be designed between the peptides and at the peptide-lipid interfaces simultaneously. Here, we take a multi-step approach towards this problem. First, we use rational de novo design to generate water-soluble \u03b1-helical barrels with polar interiors, and confirm their structures using high-resolution X-ray crystallography. These \u03b1-helical barrels have water-filled lumens like those of transmembrane channels. Next, we modify the sequences to facilitate their insertion into lipid bilayers. Single-channel electrical recordings and fluorescent imaging of the peptides in membranes show monodisperse, cation-selective channels of unitary conductance. Surprisingly, however, an X-ray structure solved from the lipidic cubic phase for one peptide reveals an alternative state with tightly packed helices and a constricted channel. To reconcile these observations, we perform computational analyses to compare the properties of possible different states of the peptide.",

        "abstract":"Soluble proteins are universally packed with a hydrophobic core and a polar surface that drive the protein folding process. Yet charged networks within the central protein core are often indispensable for the biological function. Here, we show that natural buried ion-pairs are stabilised by amphiphilic residues that electrostatically shield the charged motif from its surroundings to gain structural stability. To explore this effect, we build artificial proteins with buried ion-pairs by combining directed computational design and biophysical experiments. Our findings illustrate how perturbation in charged networks can introduce structural rearrangements to compensate for desolvation effects. We validate the physical principles by resolving high-resolution atomic structures of the artificial proteins that are resistant towards unfolding at extreme temperatures and harsh chemical conditions. Our findings provide a molecular understanding of functional charged networks and how point mutations may alter the protein's conformational landscape.",

        "abstract":"The ability to construct novel enzymes is a major aim in de novo protein design. A popular enzyme fold for design attempts is the TIM barrel. This fold is a common topology for enzymes and can harbor many diverse reactions. The recent de novo design of a four-fold symmetric TIM barrel provides a well understood minimal scaffold for potential enzyme designs. Here we explore opportunities to extend and diversify this scaffold by adding a short de novo helix on top of the barrel. Due to the size of the protein, we developed a design pipeline based on computational ab initio folding that solves a less complex sub-problem focused around the helix and its vicinity and adapt it to the entire protein. We provide biochemical characterization and a high-resolution X-ray structure for one variant and compare it to our design model. The successful extension of this robust TIM-barrel scaffold opens opportunities to diversify it towards more pocket like arrangements and as such can be considered a building block for future design of binding or catalytic sites.",

However, current structure-based methods are largely limited to natural peptides and are not suitable for designing bioactive cyclic topologies that go beyond natural l-amino acids. Here, we report a generalizable framework that exploits the computational power of Rosetta, in terms of large-scale backbone sampling, side-chain composition and energy scoring, to design heterochiral cyclic peptides that bind to a protein surface of interest. To showcase the applicability of our approach, we developed two new inhibitors ( PD-i3  and  PD-i6 ) of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), a key immune checkpoint in oncology. A comprehensive biophysical evaluation was performed to assess their binding to PD-1 as well as their blocking effect on the endogenous PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction.

We develop a hierarchical approach to designing multi-component protein assemblies from two classes of modular building blocks: designed helical repeat proteins (DHRs) and helical bundle oligomers (HBs). We first rigidly fuse DHRs to HBs to generate a large library of oligomeric building blocks. We then generate assemblies with cyclic, dihedral, and point group symmetries from these building blocks using architecture guided rigid helical fusion with new software named WORMS. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy characterization show that the hierarchical design approach can accurately generate a wide range of assemblies, including a 43\u2009nm diameter icosahedral nanocage. The computational methods and building block sets described here provide a very general route to de novo designed protein nanomaterials.",

        "abstract":"Naturally occurring protein switches have been repurposed for the development of biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications 1 . However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2 . The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the\u00a0severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3 , we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\u00a0and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid\u00a0proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder 4 , has a limit of detection of 15\u00a0pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.",

        "abstract":"Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expressed on activated T cells inhibits T cell function and proliferation to prevent an excessive immune response, and disease can result if this delicate balance is shifted in either direction. Tumor cells often take advantage of this pathway by overexpressing the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 to evade destruction by the immune system. Alternatively, if there is a decrease in function of the PD-1 pathway, unchecked activation of the immune system and autoimmunity can result. Using a combination of computation and experiment, we designed a hyperstable 40-residue miniprotein, PD-MP1, that specifically binds murine and human PD-1 at the PD-L1 interface with a K d  of \u223c100 nM. The apo crystal structure shows that the binder folds as designed with a backbone RMSD of 1.3 \u00c5 to the design model. Trimerization of PD-MP1 resulted in a PD-1 agonist that strongly inhibits murine T cell activation. This small, hyperstable PD-1 binding protein was computationally designed with an all-beta interface, and the trimeric agonist could contribute to treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract":"We describe the de novo design of an allosterically regulated protein, which comprises two tightly coupled domains. One domain is based on the DF (Due Ferri in Italian or two-iron in English) family of de novo proteins, which have a diiron cofactor that catalyzes a phenol oxidase reaction, while the second domain is based on PS1 (Porphyrin-binding Sequence), which binds a synthetic Zn-porphyrin (ZnP). The binding of ZnP to the original PS1 protein induces changes in structure and dynamics, which we expected to influence the catalytic rate of a fused DF domain when appropriately coupled. Both DF and PS1 are four-helix bundles, but they have distinct bundle architectures. To achieve tight coupling between the domains, they were connected by four helical linkers using a computational method to discover the most designable connections capable of spanning the two architectures. The resulting protein, DFP1 (Due Ferri Porphyrin), bound the two cofactors in the expected manner. The crystal structure of fully reconstituted DFP1 was also in excellent agreement with the design, and it showed the ZnP cofactor bound over 12 \u00c5 from the dimetal center. Next, a substrate-binding cleft leading to the diiron center was introduced into DFP1. The resulting protein acts as an allosterically modulated phenol oxidase. Its Michaelis-Menten parameters were strongly affected by the binding of ZnP, resulting in a fourfold tighter  K  m  and a 7-fold decrease in  k  cat  These studies establish the feasibility of designing allosterically regulated catalytic proteins, entirely from scratch.",

        "abstract":"Carbohydrates are often utilized to provide hydrophilicity and hydroxyl-based hydrogen bonds in self-assembling glycopeptides, affording versatile scaffolds with wide applicability in biomedical research. However, how stereochemistry of carbohydrates impacts the self-assembly process remains unclear. Here we have established a dimeric tyrosine-rich glycopeptide system for probing the corresponding hydrogelating behavior under the influence of site- and stereospecific glycosylations. Comparison of 18 glycoforms bearing monosaccharides at Tyr 4  and Tyr 4'  shows that the glycopeptides with either \u03b1- or \u03b2-anomers exhibit contrary gelating abilities, when the glycan moieties contain axial hydroxyl groups. A high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structure of the \u03b2-galactose-containing gelator, along with other results from spectroscopic, microscopic, and rheological experiments, indicate an unusual carbohydrate-aromatic CH-\u03c0 bonding that promotes glycopeptide self-assembly. These mechanistic findings, particularly evidence obtained at the angstrom scale, illuminate an unconventional role that carbohydrates can play in building supramolecules. Potential biomaterials exploiting the CH-\u03c0 bond-based stabilization, as exemplified by an enzyme-resistant hydrogel, may thus be developed.",

To enable a new generation of anti-viral vaccines, we designed self-assembling protein nanoparticles with geometries tailored to present the ectodomains of influenza, HIV, and RSV viral glycoprotein trimers. We first  de novo  designed trimers tailored for antigen fusion, featuring N-terminal helices positioned to match the C termini of the viral glycoproteins. Trimers that experimentally adopted their designed configurations were incorporated as components of tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticles, which were characterized by cryo-electron microscopy and assessed for their ability to present viral glycoproteins. Electron microscopy and antibody binding experiments demonstrated that the designed nanoparticles presented antigenically intact prefusion HIV-1 Env, influenza hemagglutinin, and RSV F trimers in the predicted geometries. This work demonstrates that antigen-displaying protein nanoparticles can be designed from scratch, and provides a systematic way to investigate the influence of antigen presentation geometry on the immune response to vaccination.",

        "abstract":"Following immunization, high-affinity antibody responses develop within germinal centers (GCs), specialized sites within follicles of the lymph node (LN) where B cells proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation. Antigen availability within GCs is important, as B cells must acquire and present antigen to follicular helper T cells to drive this process. However, recombinant protein immunogens such as soluble human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) trimers do not efficiently accumulate in follicles following traditional immunization. Here, we demonstrate two strategies to concentrate HIV Env immunogens in follicles, via the formation of immune complexes (ICs) or by employing self-assembling protein nanoparticles for multivalent display of Env antigens. Using rhesus macaques, we show that within a few days following immunization, free trimers were present in a diffuse pattern in draining LNs, while trimer ICs and Env nanoparticles accumulated in B cell follicles. Whole LN imaging strikingly revealed that ICs and trimer nanoparticles concentrated in as many as 500 follicles in a single LN within two days after immunization. Imaging of LNs collected seven days postimmunization showed that Env nanoparticles persisted on follicular dendritic cells in the light zone of nascent GCs. These findings suggest that the form of antigen administered in vaccination can dramatically impact localization in lymphoid tissues and provides a new rationale for the enhanced immune responses observed following immunization with ICs or nanoparticles.",

        "abstract":"Following immunization, high-affinity antibody responses develop within germinal centers (GCs), specialized sites within follicles of the lymph node (LN) where B cells proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation. Antigen availability within GCs is important, as B cells must acquire and present antigen to follicular helper T cells to drive this process. However, recombinant protein immunogens such as soluble human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) trimers do not efficiently accumulate in follicles following traditional immunization. Here, we demonstrate two strategies to concentrate HIV Env immunogens in follicles, via the formation of immune complexes (ICs) or by employing self-assembling protein nanoparticles for multivalent display of Env antigens. Using rhesus macaques, we show that within a few days following immunization, free trimers were present in a diffuse pattern in draining LNs, while trimer ICs and Env nanoparticles accumulated in B cell follicles. Whole LN imaging strikingly revealed that ICs and trimer nanoparticles concentrated in as many as 500 follicles in a single LN within two days after immunization. Imaging of LNs collected seven days postimmunization showed that Env nanoparticles persisted on follicular dendritic cells in the light zone of nascent GCs. These findings suggest that the form of antigen administered in vaccination can dramatically impact localization in lymphoid tissues and provides a new rationale for the enhanced immune responses observed following immunization with ICs or nanoparticles.",

To enable a new generation of anti-viral vaccines, we designed self-assembling protein nanoparticles with geometries tailored to present the ectodomains of influenza, HIV, and RSV viral glycoprotein trimers. We first  de novo  designed trimers tailored for antigen fusion, featuring N-terminal helices positioned to match the C termini of the viral glycoproteins. Trimers that experimentally adopted their designed configurations were incorporated as components of tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticles, which were characterized by cryo-electron microscopy and assessed for their ability to present viral glycoproteins. Electron microscopy and antibody binding experiments demonstrated that the designed nanoparticles presented antigenically intact prefusion HIV-1 Env, influenza hemagglutinin, and RSV F trimers in the predicted geometries. This work demonstrates that antigen-displaying protein nanoparticles can be designed from scratch, and provides a systematic way to investigate the influence of antigen presentation geometry on the immune response to vaccination.",

Computational design of protein nanoparticles with differing sizes and geometries enables combination with antigens of choice to test novel multimerization concepts in immunization strategies where the goal is to improve the induction and maturation of neutralizing antibody lineages. Here, we describe detailed antigenic, structural, and functional characterization of computationally designed tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticle immunogens displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomains. Env trimers, based on subtype A (BG505) or consensus group M (ConM) sequences and engineered with SOSIP stabilizing mutations, were fused to an underlying trimeric building block of each nanoparticle. Initial screening yielded one icosahedral and two tetrahedral nanoparticle candidates, capable of presenting twenty or four copies of the Env trimer. A number of analyses, including detailed structural characterization by cryo-EM, demonstrated that the nanoparticle immunogens possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties. When the immunogenicity of ConM-SOSIP trimers presented on a two-component tetrahedral nanoparticle or as soluble proteins were compared in rabbits, the two immunogens elicited similar serum antibody binding titers against the trimer component. Neutralizing antibody titers were slightly elevated in the animals given the nanoparticle immunogen and were initially more focused to the trimer apex. Altogether, our findings indicate that tetrahedral nanoparticles can be successfully applied for presentation of HIV Env trimer immunogens; however, the optimal implementation to different immunization strategies remains to be determined.",

This size diversity can be explained by the evolutionary process of gene duplication and fusion. In this study, we investigated a distorted \u03b2-propeller protein, an apparent intermediate between two symmetries. From this template, we created a perfectly symmetric 9-bladed \u03b2-propeller named Cake, using computational design and ancestral sequence reconstruction. The designed repeat sequence was found to be capable of generating both 8-fold and 9-fold propellers which are highly stable. Cake variants with 2-10 identical copies of the repeat sequence were characterised by X-ray crystallography and in solution. They were found to be highly stable, and to self-assemble into 8- or 9-fold symmetrical propellers. These findings show that the \u03b2-propeller fold allows sufficient structural plasticity to permit a given blade to assemble different forms, a transition from even to odd changes in blade number, and provide a potential explanation for the wide diversity of repeat numbers observed in natural propeller proteins.

This size diversity can be explained by the evolutionary process of gene duplication and fusion. In this study, we investigated a distorted \u03b2-propeller protein, an apparent intermediate between two symmetries. From this template, we created a perfectly symmetric 9-bladed \u03b2-propeller named Cake, using computational design and ancestral sequence reconstruction. The designed repeat sequence was found to be capable of generating both 8-fold and 9-fold propellers which are highly stable. Cake variants with 2-10 identical copies of the repeat sequence were characterised by X-ray crystallography and in solution. They were found to be highly stable, and to self-assemble into 8- or 9-fold symmetrical propellers. These findings show that the \u03b2-propeller fold allows sufficient structural plasticity to permit a given blade to assemble different forms, a transition from even to odd changes in blade number, and provide a potential explanation for the wide diversity of repeat numbers observed in natural propeller proteins.

        "abstract":"De novo protein design has been successful in expanding the natural protein repertoire. However, most de novo proteins lack biological function, presenting a major methodological challenge. In vaccinology, the induction of precise antibody responses remains a cornerstone for next-generation vaccines. Here, we present a protein design algorithm called TopoBuilder, with which we engineered epitope-focused immunogens displaying complex structural motifs. In both mice and nonhuman primates, cocktails of three de novo-designed immunogens induced robust neutralizing responses against the respiratory syncytial virus. Furthermore, the immunogens refocused preexisting antibody responses toward defined neutralization epitopes. Overall, our design approach opens the possibility of targeting specific epitopes for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies and, more generally, will be applicable to the design of de novo proteins displaying complex functional motifs.",

        "abstract":"Recently, we designed and assembled protein nanobuilding blocks (PN-Blocks) from an intermolecularly folded dimeric  de novo  protein called WA20. Using this dimeric 4-helix bundle, we constructed a series of self-assembling supramolecular nanostructures including polyhedra and chain-type complexes. Here we describe the stabilization of WA20 by designing mutations that stabilize the helices and hydrophobic core. The redesigned proteins denature with substantially higher midpoints, with the most stable variant, called Super WA20 (SUWA), displaying an extremely high midpoint ( T  m  = 122 \u00b0C), much higher than the  T  m  of WA20 (75 \u00b0C). The crystal structure of SUWA reveals an intermolecularly folded dimer with bisecting U topology, similar to the parental WA20 structure, with two long \u03b1-helices of a protomer intertwined with the helices of another protomer. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the redesigned hydrophobic core in the center of SUWA significantly suppresses the deformation of helices observed in the same region of WA20, suggesting this is a critical factor stabilizing the SUWA structure. This hyperstable  de novo  protein is expected to be useful as nanoscale pillars of PN-Block components in new types of self-assembling nanoarchitectures.",

        "abstract":"Aberrant Ras signaling drives 30% of cancers, and inhibition of the Rho family small GTPase signaling has been shown to combat Ras-driven cancers. Here, we present the discovery of a 16-mer cyclic peptide that binds to Cdc42 with nanomolar affinity. Affinity maturation of this sequence has produced a panel of derived candidates with increased affinity and modulated specificity for other closely-related small GTPases. The structure of the tightest binding peptide was solved by NMR, and its binding site on Cdc42 was determined. Addition of a cell-penetrating sequence allowed the peptides to access the cell interior and engage with their target(s), modulating signaling pathways. In Ras-driven cancer cell models, the peptides have an inhibitory effect on proliferation and show suppression of both invasion and motility. As such, they represent promising candidates for Rho-family small GTPase inhibitors and therapeutics targeting Ras-driven cancers. Our data add to the growing literature demonstrating that peptides are establishing their place in the biologics arm of drug discovery.",
