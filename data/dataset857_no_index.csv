Strong, attractive electrostatic interactions, between the anionic groups of SDS and the cationic groups of the lysines, appeared to be necessary to initiate the folding of the basic peptide.

These results enabled us to propose a working model of the basic peptide-SDS complex, and a mechanism for SDS-induced alpha-helical folding.

Randomly generated sequences, however, rarely fold into well ordered protein-like structures. To enhance the quality of a library, diversity must be focused into those regions of sequence space most likely to yield well folded structures. We have constructed focused libraries of de novo sequences by designing the binary pattern of polar and nonpolar amino acids to favor structures that contain abundant secondary structure, while simultaneously burying hydrophobic side chains in the protein interior and exposing hydrophilic side chains to solvent. Because binary patterning specifies only the polar/nonpolar periodicity, but not the identities of the side chains, detailed structural features, including packing interactions, cannot be designed a priori. Can binary patterned libraries nonetheless encode well folded proteins? An unambiguous answer to this question requires determination of a 3D structure. We used NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of S-824, a novel protein from a recently constructed library of 102-residue sequences. This library is ""naïve"" in that it has not been subjected to high-throughput screens or directed evolution. The experimentally determined structure of S-824 is a four-helix bundle, as specified by the design. As dictated by the binary-code strategy, nonpolar side chains are buried in the protein interior, and polar side chains are exposed to solvent. The polypeptide backbone and buried side chains are well ordered, demonstrating that S-824 is not a molten globule and forms a unique structure. These results show that amino acid sequences that have neither been selected by evolution, nor designed by computer, nor isolated by high-throughput screening, can form native-like structures.

Mimochromes consist of two medium-sized helical peptides, covalently linked to the deuteroporphyrin. CD and NMR characterization of the prototype, mimochrome I, revealed that the overall structure conforms well to the design. However, formation of Delta and Lambda diastereomers was observed. To overcome the problem of diastereomer formation, we re-designed mimochrome I, by engineering intramolecular, interchain interactions. The resulting model was mimochrome IV: the solution structural characterization showed the presence of the Lambda isomer as a unique form. To examine the extent to which the stereochemical stability and uniqueness of mimochrome IV was retained in the solid state, the crystal structure of Co(III)-mimochrome IV was solved by X-ray diffraction, and compared to the solution structure of the same derivative. Co(III)-mimochrome IV structures, both in solution and in the solid state, are characterized by the following common features: a bis-His axial coordination, a Lambda configuration around the metal ion, and a predominant helical conformation of the peptide chains. However, in the crystal structure, intrachain Glu1-Arg9 ion pairs are preferred over the designed, and experimentally found in solution, interchain interactions.

Thermodynamic parameters are compared with those of the homologous leucine zipper AB(SS) in which the A and B chains are disulfide-linked. NMR structures of AB based on (1)H NMR data collected at 600 MHz converge, and formation of the same six interchain salt bridges found previously in disulfide-linked AB(SS) [Marti, D.

The stability of AB peaks at pH approximately 4.5 and is higher at pH 8 than at pH 2. In contrast, AB(SS) is most stable at acidic pH where no interhelical salt bridges are formed. The different energetic contributions of charged Glu and His residues to stability of the two coiled coil structures were evaluated from pK(a) shifts induced by folding. The six charged Glu residues involved in salt bridges stabilize leucine zipper AB by 4.5 kJ/mol yet destabilize disulfide-linked AB(SS) by -1.1 kJ/mol. Two non-ion-paired Glu charges destabilize AB by only -1.8 kJ/mol but AB(SS) by -5.6 kJ/mol. The higher relative stability of AB at neutral pH is not caused by more favorable electrostatic interactions in the folded leucine zipper. It is due mainly to unfavorable electrostatic interactions in the unfolded A and B chains and may therefore be called an inverse electrostatic effect.

The use of C(2) symmetry is particularly advantageous, because it simplifies the design, synthesis and characterization. However, it leaves the problem of possible diastereomeric forms. In the cobalt complex of the first derivative, mimochrome I, Lambda and Delta isomers were indeed experimentally observed. All the insights derived from the Co(III)-mimochrome I structure were used to obtain a re-designed molecule, mimochrome IV. The spectroscopic characterization of the iron and cobalt derivatives suggested the presence of the Lambda isomer as unique species.

DARPins were previously selected against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) with low nanomolar affinities. We describe here their affinity maturation by error-prone PCR and ribosome display yielding clones with zero to seven (average 2.5) amino acid substitutions in framework positions. The DARPin with highest affinity (90 pM) carried four mutations at framework positions, leading to a 3000-fold affinity increase compared to the consensus framework variant, mainly coming from a 500-fold increase of the on-rate. This DARPin was found to be highly sensitive in detecting Her2 in human carcinoma extracts. We have determined the crystal structure of this DARPin at 1.7 A, and found that a His to Tyr mutation at the framework position 52 alters the inter-repeat H-bonding pattern and causes a significant conformational change in the relative disposition of the repeat subdomains. These changes are thought to be the reason for the enhanced on-rate of the mutated DARPin. The DARPin not bearing the residue 52 mutation has an unusually slow on-rate, suggesting that binding occurred via conformational selection of a relatively rare state, which was stabilized by this His52Tyr mutation, increasing the on-rate again to typical values. An analysis of the structural location of the framework mutations suggests that randomization of some framework residues either by error-prone PCR or by design in a future library could increase affinities and the target binding spectrum.",,"{'length_a': ['152.080'], 'length_b': ['52.191'], 'length_c': ['70.164'], 'angle_a': ['90.00'], 'angle_b': ['105.19'], 'angle_g': ['90.00']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],14618.437,

The structural and dynamical analyses of (Aalpha(2)-L1M/L38M)(2) in the absence of anesthetics (another study) showed a highly dynamic antiparallel dimer with an asymmetric arrangement of the four helices and a lateral accessing pathway from the aqueous phase to the hydrophobic core. In this study, we determined the high-resolution NMR structure of (Aalpha(2)-L1M/L38M)(2) in the presence of halothane, a clinically used volatile anesthetic. The high-solution NMR structure, with a backbone root mean-square deviation of 1.72 A (2JST), and the NMR binding measurements revealed that the primary halothane binding site is located between two side-chains of W15 from each monomer, different from the initially designed anesthetic binding sites. Hydrophobic interactions with residues A44 and L18 also contribute to stabilizing the bound halothane. Whereas halothane produces minor changes in the monomer structure, the quaternary arrangement of the dimer is shifted by about half a helical turn and twists relative to each other, which leads to the closure of the lateral access pathway to the hydrophobic core. Quantitative dynamics analyses, including Modelfree analysis of the relaxation data and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill transverse relaxation dispersion measurements, suggest that the most profound anesthetic effect is the suppression of the conformational exchange both near and remote from the binding site. Our results revealed a novel mechanism of an induced fit between anesthetic molecule and its protein target, with the direct consequence of protein dynamics changing on a global rather than a local scale.

Given the enormity of sequence space, a rational approach to library design is likely to yield a higher fraction of folded and functional proteins than a stochastic sampling of random sequences. We previously investigated the potential of library design by binary patterning of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids. The structure of the most stable protein from a binary patterned library of de novo 4-helix bundles was solved previously and shown to be consistent with the design. One structure, however, cannot fully assess the potential of the design strategy, nor can it account for differences in the stabilities of individual proteins. To more fully probe the quality of the library, we now report the NMR structure of a second protein, S-836. Protein S-836 proved to be a 4-helix bundle, consistent with design. The similarity between the two solved structures reinforces previous evidence that binary patterning can encode stable, 4-helix bundles. Despite their global similarities, the two proteins have cores that are packed at different degrees of tightness. The relationship between packing and dynamics was probed using the Modelfree approach, which showed that regions containing a high frequency of chemical exchange coincide with less well-packed side chains. These studies show (1) that binary patterning can drive folding into a particular topology without the explicit design of residue-by-residue packing, and (2) that within a superfamily of binary patterned proteins, the structures and dynamics of individual proteins are modulated by the identity and packing of residues in the hydrophobic core.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['SOLUTION NMR'],11946.391,

High resolution structural information for natural collagens has been difficult to obtain because of their size and the heterogeneity of their native environment. For this reason, peptides that self-assemble into collagen-like triple helices are used to gain insight into the structure, stability, and biochemistry of this important protein family. Although many of the most common collagens in humans are heterotrimers, almost all studies of collagen helices have been on homotrimers. Here we report the first structure of a collagen heterotrimer. Our structure, obtained by solution NMR, highlights the role of electrostatic interactions as stabilizing factors within the triple helical folding motif. This addresses an issue that has been actively researched because of the predominance of charged residues in the collagen family. We also find that it is possible to selectively form a collagen heterotrimer with a well defined composition and register of the peptide chains within the helix, based on information encoded solely in the collagenous domain. Globular domains are implicated in determining the composition of several collagen types, but it is unclear what their role in controlling register may be. We show that is possible to design peptides that not only selectively choose a composition but also a specific register without the assistance of other protein constructs.

In the crystal structure, three sulfate ions complement this network. Thermal denaturation experiments in guanidine hydrochloride directly indicate a contribution of sulfate binding to the stability, providing further evidence for the stabilizing effect of surface-exposed electrostatic interactions and regular charge networks.

For a better understanding of primordial protein evolution, we synthesized an artificial protein on the basis of an evolutionary hypothesis, segment-based elongation starting from an autonomously foldable short peptide. A 10-residue protein, chignolin, the smallest foldable polypeptide ever reported, was used as a structural support to facilitate higher structural organization and gain-of-function in the development of an artificial protein. Repetitive cycles of segment elongation and subsequent phage display selection successfully produced a 25-residue protein, termed AF.2A1, with nanomolar affinity against the Fc region of immunoglobulin G. AF.2A1 shows exquisite molecular recognition ability such that it can distinguish conformational differences of the same molecule. The structure determined by NMR measurements demonstrated that AF.2A1 forms a globular protein-like conformation with the chignolin-derived β-hairpin and a tryptophan-mediated hydrophobic core. Using sequence analysis and a mutation study, we discovered that the structural organization and gain-of-function emerged from the vicinity of the chignolin segment, revealing that the structural support served as the core in both structural and functional development. Here, we propose an evolutionary model for primordial proteins in which a foldable segment serves as the evolving core to facilitate structural and functional evolution.

Despite accumulating evidence for the formation of TPR oligomers as an additional level of regulation there is a lack of structural and solution data explaining TPR self-association. In the present work we characterize the trimeric TPR-containing protein YbgF, which is linked to the Tol system in Gram-negative bacteria. By subtracting previously identified TPR consensus residues required for stability of the fold from residues conserved across YbgF homologs, we identified residues involved in oligomerization of the C-terminal YbgF TPR domain. Crafting these residues, which are located in loop regions between TPR motifs, onto the monomeric consensus TPR protein CTPR3 induced the formation of oligomers. The crystal structure of this engineered oligomer shows an asymmetric trimer where stacking interactions between the introduced tyrosines and displacement of the C-terminal hydrophilic capping helix, present in most TPR domains, are key to oligomerization. Asymmetric trimerization of the YbgF TPR domain and CTPR3Y3 leads to the formation of higher order oligomers both in the crystal and in solution. However, such open-ended self-association does not occur in full-length YbgF suggesting that the protein's N-terminal coiled-coil domain restricts further oligomerization. This interpretation is borne out in experiments where the coiled-coil domain of YbgF was engineered onto the N-terminus of CTPR3Y3 and shown to block self-association beyond trimerization. Our study lays the foundations for understanding the structural basis for TPR domain self-association and how such self-association can be regulated in TPR domain-containing proteins.",,"{'length_a': ['62.284'], 'length_b': ['62.284'], 'length_c': ['120.368'], 'angle_a': ['90.00'], 'angle_b': ['90.00'], 'angle_g': ['120.00']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],14513.486,

This is because there are few reports of structural characterization of such systems either in their metalated or nonmetalated forms and no examples where an apo structure and the corresponding metalated peptide assembly have both been defined by X-ray crystallography. Herein we present X-ray structures of two de novo designed parallel three-stranded coiled coils (designed using the heptad repeat (a → g)) CSL9C (CS = Coil Ser) and CSL19C in their nonmetalated forms, determined to 1.36 and 2.15 A resolutions, respectively. Leucines from either position 9 (a site) or 19 (d site) are replaced by cysteine to generate the constructs CSL9C and CSL19C, respectively, yielding thiol-rich pockets at the hydrophobic interior of these peptides, suitable to bind heavy metals such as As(III), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). We use these structures to understand the inherent structural differences between a and d sites to clarify the basis of the observed differential spectroscopic behavior of metal binding in these types of peptides. Cys side chains of (CSL9C)(3) show alternate conformations and are partially preorganized for metal binding, whereas cysteines in (CSL19C)(3) are present as a single conformer. Zn(II) ions, which do not coordinate or influence Cys residues at the designed metal sites but are essential for forming X-ray quality crystals, are bound to His and Glu residues at the crystal packing interfaces of both structures. These ""apo"" structures are used to clarify the changes in metal site organization between metalated As(CSL9C)(3) and to speculate on the differential basis of Hg(II) binding in a versus d peptides.

This is because there are few reports of structural characterization of such systems either in their metalated or nonmetalated forms and no examples where an apo structure and the corresponding metalated peptide assembly have both been defined by X-ray crystallography. Herein we present X-ray structures of two de novo designed parallel three-stranded coiled coils (designed using the heptad repeat (a → g)) CSL9C (CS = Coil Ser) and CSL19C in their nonmetalated forms, determined to 1.36 and 2.15 A resolutions, respectively. Leucines from either position 9 (a site) or 19 (d site) are replaced by cysteine to generate the constructs CSL9C and CSL19C, respectively, yielding thiol-rich pockets at the hydrophobic interior of these peptides, suitable to bind heavy metals such as As(III), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). We use these structures to understand the inherent structural differences between a and d sites to clarify the basis of the observed differential spectroscopic behavior of metal binding in these types of peptides. Cys side chains of (CSL9C)(3) show alternate conformations and are partially preorganized for metal binding, whereas cysteines in (CSL19C)(3) are present as a single conformer. Zn(II) ions, which do not coordinate or influence Cys residues at the designed metal sites but are essential for forming X-ray quality crystals, are bound to His and Glu residues at the crystal packing interfaces of both structures. These ""apo"" structures are used to clarify the changes in metal site organization between metalated As(CSL9C)(3) and to speculate on the differential basis of Hg(II) binding in a versus d peptides. Thus, for the first time, one can establish general rules for heavy metal binding to Cys-rich sites in designed proteins which may provide insight for understanding how heavy metals bind to metallochaperones or metalloregulatory proteins.",,"{'length_a': ['77.940'], 'length_b': ['29.856'], 'length_c': ['44.361'], 'angle_a': ['90.00'], 'angle_b': ['119.15'], 'angle_g': ['90.00']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],3325.850,Synthesized in automated peptide synthesizer

The 54-membered ring macrocyclic peptide (1a) contains molecular template and turn units that induce beta-sheet structure in a heptapeptide strand that forms the dimerization interface. The X-ray crystallographic structure reveals the structures of the two ""Hao"" amino acids that help template the beta-sheet structure and the two delta-linked ornithine turn units that link the Hao-containing template to the heptapeptide beta-strand. The Hao amino acids adopt a conformation that resembles a tripeptide in a beta-strand conformation, with one edge of the Hao unit presenting an alternating array of hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor groups in the same pattern as that of a tripeptide beta-strand. The delta-linked ornithines adopt a conformation that resembles a hydrogen-bonded beta-turn, in which the ornithine takes the place of the i+1 and i+2 residues. The dimers formed by macrocyclic beta-sheet 1a resemble the dimers of many proteins, such as defensin HNP-3, the lambda-Cro repressor, interleukin 8, and the ribonuclease H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The dimers of 1a self-assemble in the solid state into a barrel-shaped trimer of dimers in which the three dimers are arranged in a triangular fashion.

These structures provide inspiration for the de novo design of biomimetic assemblies, both to address difficulties in studying and understanding natural systems, and to provide routes to new biomaterials with potential applications in nanotechnology and medicine. We have designed a self-assembling fiber system, the SAFs, in which two small α-helical peptides are programmed to form a dimeric coiled coil and assemble in a controlled manner. The resulting fibers are tens of nm wide and tens of μm long, and, therefore, comprise millions of peptides to give gigadalton supramolecular structures. Here, we describe the structure of the SAFs determined to approximately 8 Å resolution using cryotransmission electron microscopy. Individual micrographs show clear ultrastructure that allowed direct interpretation of the packing of individual α-helices within the fibers, and the construction of a 3D electron density map. Furthermore, a model was derived using the cryotransmission electron microscopy data and side chains taken from a 2.3 Å X-ray crystal structure of a peptide building block incapable of forming fibers. This was validated using single-particle analysis techniques, and was stable in prolonged molecular-dynamics simulation, confirming its structural viability. The level of self-assembly and self-organization in the SAFs is unprecedented for a designed peptide-based material, particularly for a system of considerably reduced complexity compared with natural proteins. This structural insight is a unique high-resolution description of how α-helical fibrils pack into larger protein fibers, and provides a basis for the design and engineering of future biomaterials.",,"{'length_a': ['45.082'], 'length_b': ['45.082'], 'length_c': ['67.593'], 'angle_a': ['90.000'], 'angle_b': ['90.000'], 'angle_g': ['120.000']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],3287.498,Peptide synthesis was carried out according to standard fmoc spps protocols

We find important differences in the side chain conformation of amino acids in the crystalline and solution state. Structures from x-ray crystallography may have similarities to the densely packed triple helices of collagen fibers whereas solution NMR structures reveal the simpler interactions of isolated triple helices. In solution, two distinct types of contacts are observed: axial and lateral. Such register-specific interactions are crucial for the understanding of the registration process of collagens and the overall stability of proteins in this family.

WA20, picked from the library, is one of the most stable proteins in the superfamily, and has rudimentary activities such as esterase and lipase. Here we report the crystal structure of WA20, determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method. Unexpectedly, the WA20 crystal structure is not a monomeric four-helix bundle, but a dimeric four-helix bundle. Each monomer comprises two long α-helices that intertwist with the helices of the other monomer. The two monomers together form a 3D domain-swapped four-helix bundle dimer. In addition, there are two hydrophobic pockets, which may potentially provide substrate binding sites. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that the molecular weight of WA20 is ~25 kDa and the shape is rod-like (the maximum length, D(max) = ~8 nm), indicating that WA20 forms a dimeric four-helix bundle in solution.

Herein, a computational approach is presented for the design of proteins that self-assemble in three dimensions to yield macroscopic crystals. A three-helix coiled-coil protein is designed de novo to form a polar, layered, three-dimensional crystal having the P6 space group, which has a ""honeycomb-like"" structure and hexameric channels that span the crystal. The approach involves: (i) creating an ensemble of crystalline structures consistent with the targeted symmetry; (ii) characterizing this ensemble to identify ""designable"" structures from minima in the sequence-structure energy landscape and designing sequences for these structures; (iii) experimentally characterizing candidate proteins. A 2.1 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of one such designed protein exhibits sub-Å agreement [backbone root mean square deviation (rmsd)] with the computational model of the crystal.

A statistical analysis of 80 Arg residues in various triple-helical peptides showed that, unlike those in globular proteins, they preferentially adopt a tt conformation for χ1 and χ2 , as observed in POG3-PRG-POG4.

As a test case, we have created a sixfold symmetrical β-propeller protein and experimentally validated the structure using X-ray crystallography. Each blade consists of 42 residues. Proteins carrying 2-10 identical blades were also expressed and purified.

Designing predetermined crystal structures can be subtle given the complexity of proteins and the noncovalent interactions that govern crystallization. De novo protein design provides an approach to engineer highly complex nanoscale molecular structures, and often the positions of atoms can be programmed with sub-Å precision. Herein, a computational approach is presented for the design of proteins that self-assemble in three dimensions to yield macroscopic crystals. A three-helix coiled-coil protein is designed de novo to form a polar, layered, three-dimensional crystal having the P6 space group, which has a ""honeycomb-like"" structure and hexameric channels that span the crystal. The approach involves: (i) creating an ensemble of crystalline structures consistent with the targeted symmetry; (ii) characterizing this ensemble to identify ""designable"" structures from minima in the sequence-structure energy landscape and designing sequences for these structures; (iii) experimentally characterizing candidate proteins. A 2.1 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of one such designed protein exhibits sub-Å agreement [backbone root mean square deviation (rmsd)] with the computational model of the crystal.

Ideally, such components should be highly defined and predictable in all respects of sequence, structure, stability, interactions, and function. To establish one such toolkit, here we present a basis set of de novo designed α-helical coiled-coil peptides that adopt defined and well-characterized parallel dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric states. The designs are based on sequence-to-structure relationships both from the literature and analysis of a database of known coiled-coil X-ray crystal structures. These give foreground sequences to specify the targeted oligomer state. A key feature of the design process is that sequence positions outside of these sites are considered non-essential for structural specificity; as such, they are referred to as the background, are kept non-descript, and are available for mutation as required later. Synthetic peptides were characterized in solution by circular-dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation, and their structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. Intriguingly, a hitherto widely used empirical rule-of-thumb for coiled-coil dimer specification does not hold in the designed system.

We design proteins with idealized serine-containing catalytic triads and assess their nucleophilicity directly in native biological systems using activity-based organophosphate probes. Crystal structures of the most successful designs show unprecedented agreement with computational models, including extensive hydrogen bonding networks between the catalytic triad (or quartet) residues, and mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that these networks are critical for serine activation and organophosphate reactivity.

The sequence of this peptide is composed of four repeats of the seven residue sequence Ile-Ala-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gln-Lys but with a Cys-X-X-Cys metal-binding motif substituted at positions 16-19. Size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering detection (SEC-MALS) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy studies showed that the apo peptide exhibits a pH-dependent oligomerization state in which a three-stranded α-helical coiled coil is dominant between pH5.4 and 8.5. The Cd(2+)-binding properties of the AQ-C16C19 peptide were studied by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS), and (113)Cd NMR techniques. The holoprotein was found to contain a polynuclear cadmium-thiolate center formed within the hydrophobic core of the triple-stranded α-helical coiled-coil structure. The X-ray crystal structure of the Cd-loaded peptide, resolved at 1.85Å resolution, revealed an adamantane-like configuration of the polynuclear metal center consisting of four cadmium ions, six thiolate sulfur ligands from cysteine residues and four oxygen-donor ligands. Three of these are from glutamic acid residues and one is from an exogenous water molecule. Thus, each cadmium ion is coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral S(3)O geometry. The metal cluster was found to form cooperatively at pH5.4 but in a stepwise fashion at pH>7. The results demonstrate that synthetic coiled-coils can be designed to incorporate multinuclear metal clusters, a proof-of-concept for their potential use in developing synthetic metalloenzymes and multi-electron redox agents.",,"{'length_a': ['30.762'], 'length_b': ['35.204'], 'length_c': ['64.123'], 'angle_a': ['90.00'], 'angle_b': ['97.49'], 'angle_g': ['90.00']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],3422.966,Peptide synthesis was done using an applied biosystems 433a and purified on a preparative c18 reverse phase hplc.

A bacterial melibiose fermentation assay was adapted for in vivo functional screen. We isolated a transcription blocker that completely inhibits the melibiose-dependent expression of α-galactosidase (MelA) and melibiose permease (MelB) of Escherichia coli by specifically preventing activation of the melAB operon. High-resolution crystal structural determination reveals that the designed ANK-N5C protein has a typical ankyrin fold, and the specific transcription blocker, ANK-N5C-281, forms a domain-swapped dimer. Functional tests suggest that the activity of MelR, a DNA-binding transcription activator and a member of AraC family of transcription factors, is inhibited by ANK-N5C-281 protein. All ANK-N5C proteins are expected to have a concave binding area with negative surface potential, suggesting that the designed ANK-N5C library proteins may facilitate the discovery of binders recognizing structural motifs with positive surface potential, like in DNA-binding proteins.

Over the past decade, sophisticated single-component nanostructures composed exclusively of nucleic acids, peptides and proteins have been reported, and these nanostructures have been used in a wide range of applications, from drug delivery to molecular computing. Despite these successes, the development of hybrid co-assemblies of nucleic acids and proteins has remained elusive. Here we use computational protein design to create a protein-DNA co-assembling nanomaterial whose assembly is driven via non-covalent interactions. To achieve this, a homodimerization interface is engineered onto the Drosophila Engrailed homeodomain (ENH), allowing the dimerized protein complex to bind to two double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules. By varying the arrangement of protein-binding sites on the dsDNA, an irregular bulk nanoparticle or a nanowire with single-molecule width can be spontaneously formed by mixing the protein and dsDNA building blocks. We characterize the protein-DNA nanowire using fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray crystallography, confirming that the nanowire is formed via the proposed mechanism. This work lays the foundation for the development of new classes of protein-DNA hybrid materials.

Computation-based design of novel protein-protein interfaces can serve as a bottom-up method to further our understanding of protein interactions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the de novo design of homodimers can be achieved to atomic-level accuracy by β-strand assembly or through metal-mediated interactions. Here, we report the design and experimental characterization of a α-helix-mediated homodimer with C2 symmetry based on a monomeric Drosophila engrailed homeodomain scaffold. A solution NMR structure shows that the homodimer exhibits parallel helical packing similar to the design model.

The resulting FN3 domain, FN3con, has unprecedented stability, with a melting temperature >100°C, a ΔG(D-N) of 15.5 kcal mol(-1) and a greatly reduced unfolding rate compared with wild-type. To determine the underlying molecular basis for stability, an X-ray crystal structure of FN3con was determined to 2.0 Å and compared with other FN3 domains of varying stabilities. The structure of FN3con reveals significantly increased salt bridge interactions that are cooperatively networked, and a highly optimized hydrophobic core. Molecular dynamics simulations of FN3con and comparison structures show the cooperative power of electrostatic and hydrophobic networks in improving FN3con stability. Taken together, our data reveal that FN3con stability does not result from a single mechanism, but rather the combination of several features and the removal of non-conserved, unfavorable interactions. The large number of sequences employed in this study has most likely enhanced the robustness of the consensus design, which is now possible due to the increased sequence availability in the post-genomic era.

The second phase challenged the community to select a near-native pose of digoxigenin from a set of decoy poses for two of the designed proteins.

The long, often flexible loops that form such cavities in many natural proteins are difficult to precisely program and thus challenging for computational protein design. Here we describe an alternative approach to this problem. We fused two stable proteins with C2 symmetry-a de novo designed dimeric ferredoxin fold and a de novo designed TIM barrel-such that their symmetry axes are aligned to create scaffolds with large cavities that can serve as binding pockets or enzymatic reaction chambers. The crystal structures of two such designs confirm the presence of a 420 cubic Ångström chamber defined by the top of the designed TIM barrel and the bottom of the ferredoxin dimer. We functionalized the scaffold by installing a metal-binding site consisting of four glutamate residues close to the symmetry axis. The protein binds lanthanide ions with very high affinity as demonstrated by tryptophan-enhanced terbium luminescence. This approach can be extended to other metals and cofactors, making this scaffold a modular platform for the design of binding proteins and biocatalysts.",,"{'length_a': ['53.199'], 'length_b': ['53.199'], 'length_c': ['64.270'], 'angle_a': ['90.000'], 'angle_b': ['90.000'], 'angle_g': ['120.000']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],21824.438,

The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and recombination of simple building blocks. The overall architecture of tandem repeat protein structures--which is dictated by the internal geometry and local packing of the repeat building blocks--is highly diverse, ranging from extended, super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners, to closed and compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding and catalysis. Here we report the development and validation of computational methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied these methods to design a series of closed α-solenoid repeat structures (α-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering, our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an example, we have successfully designed and validated closed α-solenoid repeats with a left-handed helical architecture that--to our knowledge--is not yet present in the protein structure database.",,"{'length_a': ['95.414'], 'length_b': ['119.365'], 'length_c': ['76.339'], 'angle_a': ['90.000'], 'angle_b': ['110.930'], 'angle_g': ['90.000']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],40902.375,Rosetta designed

We describe a de novo designed peptide that was discovered to switch between a parallel symmetric pentamer at pH 8 and a trimer of antiparallel dimers at pH 6. The transition between pentamer and hexamer is caused by changes in the protonation states of glutamatic acid residues with highly upshifted pKa values in both oligomer forms. The drastic conformational change coupled with the narrow pH range makes the peptide sequence an attractive candidate for introduction of pH sensing into other proteins.

Two tetramers associate with one C60, promoting further organization revealed in a 1.67-Å crystal structure. Fullerene groups occupy periodic lattice sites, sandwiched between two Tyr residues from adjacent tetramers. Strikingly, the assembly exhibits high charge conductance, whereas both the protein-alone crystal and amorphous C60 are electrically insulating.

Amyloids might also represent an early precursor in the evolution of life because of their small molecular size and their ability to self-purify and catalyze chemical reactions. They also provide attractive backbones for advanced materials. When β-strands of an amyloid are arranged parallel and in register, side chains from the same position of each chain align, facilitating metal chelation when the residues are good ligands such as histidine. High-resolution structures of metalloamyloids are needed to understand the molecular bases of metal-amyloid interactions. Here we combine solid-state NMR and structural bioinformatics to determine the structure of a zinc-bound metalloamyloid that catalyzes ester hydrolysis. The peptide forms amphiphilic parallel β-sheets that assemble into stacked bilayers with alternating hydrophobic and polar interfaces. The hydrophobic interface is stabilized by apolar side chains from adjacent sheets, whereas the hydrated polar interface houses the Zn 2+ -binding histidines with binding geometries unusual in proteins. Each Zn 2+  has two bis-coordinated histidine ligands, which bridge adjacent strands to form an infinite metal-ligand chain along the fibril axis. A third histidine completes the protein ligand environment, leaving a free site on the Zn 2+  for water activation. This structure defines a class of materials, which we call metal-peptide frameworks. The structure reveals a delicate interplay through which metal ions stabilize the amyloid structure, which in turn shapes the ligand geometry and catalytic reactivity of Zn 2 .",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['SOLID-STATE NMR'],861.042,

At longer distances, this stabilizing effect tends to drop off precipitously.

Here we explore this possibility in the context of a peptide in which a Lys residue occupies the i + 8 position relative to an i-position Glu on the solvent-exposed surface of a helix-bundle homotrimer. Variable temperature circular dichroism (CD) experiments indicate that an i + 4-position Trp enables a favorable long-range interaction between Glu and the i + 8 Lys. A substantial portion of this effect relies on the presence of a hydrogen-bond donor on the arene; however, non-polar arenes, a cyclic hydrocarbon, and an acyclic Leu side-chain can also enhance the long-range salt bridge, possibly by excluding water and ions from the space between Glu and Lys.",,"{'length_a': ['84.815'], 'length_b': ['38.516'], 'length_c': ['37.031'], 'angle_a': ['90.000'], 'angle_b': ['113.340'], 'angle_g': ['90.000']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],3939.510,

Fortunately, a sizable energy barrier impedes the conversion from native to pathogenic states. However, little is known about the structure of the related transition state.

While there has been considerable progress in designing proteins that bind transition metal ions including iron-sulfur clusters, the design of tetranuclear clusters with oxygen-rich environments has not been accomplished. Here, we describe the design of tetranuclear clusters, consisting of four Zn 2+  and four carboxylate oxygens situated at the vertices of a distorted cube-like structure. The tetra-Zn 2+  clusters are bound at a buried site within a four-helix bundle, with each helix donating a single carboxylate (Glu or Asp) and imidazole (His) ligand, as well as second- and third-shell ligands. Overall, the designed site consists of four Zn 2+  and 16 polar side chains in a fully connected hydrogen-bonded network. The designed proteins have apolar cores at the top and bottom of the bundle, which drive the assembly of the liganding residues near the center of the bundle. The steric bulk of the apolar residues surrounding the binding site was varied to determine how subtle changes in helix-helix packing affect the binding site. The crystal structures of two of four proteins synthesized were in good agreement with the overall design; both formed a distorted cuboidal site stabilized by flanking second- and third-shell interactions that stabilize the primary ligands. A third structure bound a single Zn 2+  in an unanticipated geometry, and the fourth bound multiple Zn 2+  at multiple sites at partial occupancy.

Systematic replacement of a subset of natural α-residues with various artificial building blocks in the context of a computationally designed prototype sequence leads to ""heterogeneous-backbone"" variants that undergo clean oxidative folding, adopt tertiary structures indistinguishable from that of the prototype, and enjoy proteolytic protection beyond that inherent to the topologically constrained scaffold.

Self-assembly of the peptides afforded high-aspect ratio helical nanotubes. Cryo-electron microscopy with direct electron detection was employed to analyze the structures of the solvated filaments. The 3D reconstructions from the cryo-EM maps led to atomic models for the HEAT_R1 and LRV_M3Δ1 filaments at resolutions of 6.0 and 4.4 Å, respectively. Surprisingly, despite sequence similarity at the lateral packing interface, HEAT_R1 and LRV_M3Δ1 filaments adopt the opposite helical hand and differ significantly in helical geometry, while retaining a local conformation similar to previously characterized repeat proteins of the same class. The differences in the 2 filaments could be rationalized on the basis of differences in cohesive interactions at the lateral and axial interfaces. These structural data reinforce previous observations regarding the structural plasticity of helical protein assemblies and the need for high-resolution structural analysis.

We have designed 2 synthetic peptides, HEAT_R1 and LRV_M3Δ1, based on the consensus sequences of single repeats of thermophilic HEAT (PBS_HEAT) and Leucine-Rich Variant (LRV) structural motifs, respectively. Self-assembly of the peptides afforded high-aspect ratio helical nanotubes. Cryo-electron microscopy with direct electron detection was employed to analyze the structures of the solvated filaments. The 3D reconstructions from the cryo-EM maps led to atomic models for the HEAT_R1 and LRV_M3Δ1 filaments at resolutions of 6.0 and 4.4 Å, respectively. Surprisingly, despite sequence similarity at the lateral packing interface, HEAT_R1 and LRV_M3Δ1 filaments adopt the opposite helical hand and differ significantly in helical geometry, while retaining a local conformation similar to previously characterized repeat proteins of the same class. The differences in the 2 filaments could be rationalized on the basis of differences in cohesive interactions at the lateral and axial interfaces. These structural data reinforce previous observations regarding the structural plasticity of helical protein assemblies and the need for high-resolution structural analysis.

Here we crystallographically characterize designed peptides that assemble into spiraling cross-α amyloid-like structures, which resemble twisted β-amyloid fibrils. The peptides form helical dimers, stabilized by packing of small and apolar residues, and the dimers further assemble into cross-α amyloid-like fibrils with superhelical pitches ranging from 170 Å to 200 Å. When a small residue that appeared critical for packing was converted to leucine, it resulted in structural rearrangement to a helical polymer.

The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role.

Significant sequence redesign was necessary to achieve the desired juxtaposition of nonpolar and cationic functionality, because we needed to eliminate charged side chains from positions flanking the nonpolar helix surface. Natural and designed sequences that form coiled coils are almost universally rich in acidic and basic residues at these flanking positions. Our arginine coiled-coil dimer was moderately more stable than the lysine analogue, which contrasts with behavior previously observed with helical β-amino acid oligomers bearing guanidinium versus ammonium groups.

The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair.

They are therefore important for both further understanding this complex family of proteins and use in a wide range of biomaterials and biomedical applications. CMP self-assembly is complicated by a number of factors which limit the use of CMPs including their slow rate of folding, relatively poor monomer-trimer equilibrium, and the large number of competing species possible in heterotrimeric helices. All of these problems can be solved through the formation of isopeptide bonds between lysine and either aspartate or glutamate. These amino acids serve two purposes: they first direct self-assemble, allowing for composition and register control within the triple helix, and subsequently can be covalently linked, fixing the composition and register of the assembled structure without perturbing the triple helical conformation. This self-assembly and covalent capture are demonstrated here with four different triple helices. The formation of an isopeptide bond between lysine and glutamate (K-E) is shown to be a faster and higher yielding reaction than lysine with aspartate (K-D). Additionally, K-E amide bonds increase the thermal stability, improve the refolding capabilities, and enhance the triple helical structure as compared to K-E supramolecular interactions, observed by circular dichroism. In contrast, covalent capture of triple helices with K-D amide bonds occurs slower, and the captured triple helices do not have enhanced helical structure. The crystal structure of a triple helix captured through the formation of three K-E isopeptide bonds unequivocally demonstrates the connectivity of the amide bonds formed while also confirming the preservation of the canonical triple helix. The rate of reaction and yield for covalently captured K-E triple helices along with the excellent preservation of triple helical structure demonstrate that this approach can be used to effectively capture and stabilize this important biological motif for biological and biomedical applications.",,"{'length_a': ['134.835'], 'length_b': ['14.113'], 'length_c': ['24.568'], 'angle_a': ['90.000'], 'angle_b': ['90.350'], 'angle_g': ['90.000']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],2228.375,Fmoc solid phase peptide chemistry with n-terminal acetylation and c-terminal amidation

Usually in such designs amphipathic α helices associate to form compact structures with consolidated hydrophobic cores. However, recent rational and computational designs have delivered open α-helical barrels with functionalisable cavities. By placing glycine judiciously in the helical interfaces of an α-helical barrel, we obtain both open and compact states in a single protein crystal. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate a free-energy landscape with multiple and interconverting states. Together, these findings suggest a frustrated system in which steric interactions that maintain the open barrel and the hydrophobic effect that drives complete collapse are traded-off.

These switches activate through a conformational change only when all conditions are met, generating rapid, transcription-independent responses at single-cell resolution within complex cell populations. We implement AND gates to redirect T cell specificity against tumor cells expressing two surface antigens while avoiding off-target recognition of single-antigen cells, and three-input switches that add NOT or OR logic to avoid or include cells expressing a third antigen.

We hypothesized that heterogeneous nucleation of calcium carbonate could be achieved by a structured flat molecular template that pre-organizes calcium ions on its surface. To test this hypothesis, we design helical repeat proteins (DHRs) displaying regularly spaced carboxylate arrays on their surfaces and find that both protein monomers and protein-Ca 2+  supramolecular assemblies directly nucleate nano-calcite with non-natural {110} or {202} faces while vaterite, which forms first in the absence of the proteins, is bypassed. These protein-stabilized nanocrystals then assemble by oriented attachment into calcite mesocrystals. We find further that nanocrystal size and polymorph can be tuned by varying the length and surface chemistry of the designed protein templates.

These methods largely focus on optimizing the compatibility between the designed sequence and the intended conformation, without explicit consideration of protein folding pathways. Deeply knotted proteins, whose topologies may introduce substantial barriers to folding, thus represent an interesting test case for protein design. Here we report our attempts to design proteins with trefoil (3 1 ) and pentafoil (5 1 ) knotted topologies. We extended previously described algorithms for tandem repeat protein design in order to construct deeply knotted backbones and matching designed repeat sequences (N = 3 repeats for the trefoil and N = 5 for the pentafoil). We confirmed the intended conformation for the trefoil design by X ray crystallography, and we report here on this protein's structure, stability, and folding behaviour. The pentafoil design misfolded into an asymmetric structure (despite a 5-fold symmetric sequence); two of the four repeat-repeat units matched the designed backbone while the other two diverged to form local contacts, leading to a trefoil rather than pentafoil knotted topology.

However, their success has been limited by the naturally occurring structure of the immunoglobulin dimer displaying hypervariable binding loops, which is hard to modify by traditional engineering approaches. Here, we devise geometrical principles for de novo designing single-chain immunoglobulin dimers, as a tunable two-domain architecture that optimizes biophysical properties through more favorable dimer interfaces. Guided by these principles, we computationally designed protein scaffolds that were hyperstable, structurally accurate and robust for accommodating multiple functional loops, both individually and in combination, as confirmed through biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography. We showcase the modularity of this architecture by deep-learning-based diversification, opening up the possibility for tailoring the number, positioning, and relative orientation of ligand-binding loops targeting one or two distal epitopes.

CryoEM structures of the designed inhibitor-integrin complexes are very close to the computational design models, and show that the inhibitors stabilize specific conformational states of the αvβ6 and the αvβ8 integrins. In a lung fibrosis mouse model, the αvβ6 inhibitor potently reduced fibrotic burden and improved overall lung mechanics, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of de novo designed integrin binding proteins with high selectivity.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['ELECTRON MICROSCOPY'],47898.004,

Most existing models for de novo peptide design are largely based on sequence homology that can be restricted based on evolutionarily derived protein sequences and lack the physicochemical context essential in protein folding. Generative machine learning for de novo peptide design is a promising way to synthesize theoretical data that are based on, but unique from, the observable universe. In this study, we created and tested a custom peptide generative adversarial network intended to design peptide sequences that can fold into the β-hairpin secondary structure. This deep neural network model is designed to establish a preliminary foundation of the generative approach based on physicochemical and conformational properties of 20 canonical amino acids, for example, hydrophobicity and residue volume, using extant structure-specific sequence data from the PDB. The beta generative adversarial network model robustly distinguishes secondary structures of β hairpin from α helix and intrinsically disordered peptides with an accuracy of up to 96% and generates artificial β-hairpin peptide sequences with minimum sequence identities around 31% and 50% when compared against the current NCBI PDB and nonredundant databases, respectively. These results highlight the potential of generative models specifically anchored by physicochemical and conformational property features of amino acids to expand the sequence-to-structure landscape of proteins beyond evolutionary limits.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['SOLUTION NMR'],1747.884,

This challenge can be overcome through binding pockets formed at homo-oligomeric interfaces between folded monomers. Interfaces surrounding the central homo-oligomer symmetry axes necessarily have the same symmetry and so may not be well suited to binding asymmetric molecules. To enable general recognition of arbitrary asymmetric substrates and small molecules, we developed an approach to designing asymmetric interfaces at off-axis sites on homo-oligomers, analogous to those found in native homo-oligomeric proteins such as glutamine synthetase. We symmetrically dock curved helical repeat proteins such that they form pockets at the asymmetric interface of the oligomer with sizes ranging from several angstroms, appropriate for binding a single ion, to up to more than 20 Å across. Of the 133 proteins tested, 84 had soluble expression in  E. coli , 47 had correct oligomeric states in solution, 35 had small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data largely consistent with design models, and 8 had negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) 2D class averages showing the structures coming together as designed. Both an X-ray crystal structure and a cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure are close to the computational design models. The nature of these proteins as homo-oligomers allows them to be readily built into higher-order structures such as nanocages, and the asymmetric pockets of these structures open rich possibilities for small-molecule binder design free from the constraints associated with monomer destabilization.",,"{'length_a': ['234.092'], 'length_b': ['234.092'], 'length_c': ['234.092'], 'angle_a': ['90.000'], 'angle_b': ['90.000'], 'angle_g': ['90.000']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],27825.336,

Here we report the crystal structure of a single-chain CCPO in the shape of a triangle. While neither cyclization nor the addition of nanobodies enabled crystallization, it was ultimately facilitated by the inclusion of a GCN 2  homodimer. Triangle edges are formed by the orthogonal parallel coiled-coil dimers P1:P2, P3:P4, and GCN 2  connected by short linkers. A triangle has a large central cavity and is additionally stabilized by side-chain interactions between neighboring segments at each vertex. The crystal lattice is densely packed and stabilized by a large number of contacts between triangles. Interestingly, the polypeptide chain folds into a trefoil-type protein knot topology, and AlphaFold2 fails to predict the correct fold.

We hypothesized that the model alpha-helical winter flounder antifreeze protein uses an unusual undertwisting of its alpha-helix to align its putative ice-binding threonine residues in exactly the same direction. We test this hypothesis by designing a series of straight three-helix bundles with an ice-binding helix projecting threonines and two supporting helices constraining the twist of the ice-binding helix.

We hypothesized that replacement of terminal inter-β-strand hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) may lead to conformationally-defined macrocyclic β-sheets without the requirement for natural or synthetic β-turns, thereby providing a minimal mimic of a protein β-sheet. To access turn-less antiparallel β-sheet mimics, we developed a facile solid phase synthesis protocol. We surveyed a dataset of protein β-sheets for naturally observed interstrand side chain interactions. This bioinformatics survey highlighted an over-abundance of aromatic-aromatic, cation-π and ionic interactions in β-sheets. In correspondence with natural β-sheets, we find that minimal HBS mimics show robust β-sheet formation when specific amino acid residue pairings are incorporated. In isolated β-sheets, aromatic interactions endow superior conformational stability over ionic or cation-π interactions.

The corresponding target recognition mechanisms are mostly elusive because of challenges in performing detailed structural analysis of highly dynamic IDP-IDP complexes. Here, we show that by combining recently developed computational approaches with experiments, the structure of the complex between the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of protein 4.1G and its target IDP region in NuMA can be dissected at high resolution. First, we carry out systematic mutational scanning using dihydrofolate reductase-based protein complementarity analysis to identify essential interaction regions and key residues. The results are found to be highly consistent with an α/β-type complex structure predicted by AlphaFold2 (AF2). We then design mutants based on the predicted structure using a deep learning protein sequence design method. The solved crystal structure of one mutant presents the same core structure as predicted by AF2. Further computational prediction and experimental assessment indicate that the well-defined core structure is conserved across complexes of 4.1G CTD with other potential targets. Thus, we reveal that an intrinsically disordered protein interaction domain uses an α/β-type structure module formed through synergistic folding to recognize broad IDP targets. Moreover, we show that computational prediction and experiment can be jointly applied to segregate true IDP regions from the core structural domains of IDP-IDP complexes and to uncover the structure-dependent mechanisms of some otherwise elusive IDP-IDP interactions.",,"{'length_a': ['93.171'], 'length_b': ['93.171'], 'length_c': ['55.562'], 'angle_a': ['90.000'], 'angle_b': ['90.000'], 'angle_g': ['90.000']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],8145.823,

Previously, peptide-metal frameworks using short sequences (≤3 residues) have shown great promise as proteomimetic materials that exhibit sophisticated capabilities. However, their development has been hindered due to few variable residues and restricted choice of side-chains that are compatible with metal ions. Herein, we developed a noncovalent strategy featuring π-stacking bipyridyl residues to assemble much longer peptides into crystalline frameworks that tolerate even previously incompatible acidic and basic functionalities and allow an unprecedented level of pore variations. Single-crystal X-ray structures are provided for all variants to guide and validate rational design.

The TIM barrel fold is an important target for these efforts as it is highly enriched for diverse functions in nature. Although a TIM barrel protein has been designed de novo, the ability to finely alter the curvature of the central beta barrel and the overall architecture of the fold remains elusive, limiting its utility for functional design. Here, we report the de novo design of a TIM barrel with ovoid (twofold) symmetry, drawing inspiration from natural beta and TIM barrels with ovoid curvature. We use an autoregressive backbone sampling strategy to implement our hypothesis for elongated barrel curvature, followed by an iterative enrichment sequence design protocol to obtain sequences which yield a high proportion of successfully folding designs. Designed sequences are highly stable and fold to the designed barrel curvature as determined by a 2.1 Å resolution crystal structure. The designs show robustness to drastic mutations, retaining high melting temperatures even when multiple charged residues are buried in the hydrophobic core or when the hydrophobic core is ablated to alanine.

One promising approach to addressing this challenge is the design of metal-dependent associating proteins. Such designed proteins typically have Cys or His residues at the protein surface for connecting the associating proteins through metal-ion coordination. However, Cys and His residues favor interactions with soft and borderline metal ions, such as Au +  and Zn 2+ , classified by the hard and soft acids and bases concept, restricting the types of metal ions available to drive association. Here, we show the alkaline earth (AE) metal-dependent association of the recently designed artificial protein nanocage TIP60, which is composed of 60-mer fusion proteins. The introduction of a Glu (hard base) mutation to the fusion protein (K67E mutant) prevented the formation of the 60-mer but formed the expected cage structure in the presence of Ca, Sr, or Ba ions (hard acids). Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis indicated a Ba ion at the interface of the subunits.

These methods largely focus on optimizing the compatibility between the designed sequence and the intended conformation, without explicit consideration of protein folding pathways. Deeply knotted proteins, whose topologies may introduce substantial barriers to folding, thus represent an interesting test case for protein design. Here we report our attempts to design proteins with trefoil (3 1 ) and pentafoil (5 1 ) knotted topologies. We extended previously described algorithms for tandem repeat protein design in order to construct deeply knotted backbones and matching designed repeat sequences (N = 3 repeats for the trefoil and N = 5 for the pentafoil). We confirmed the intended conformation for the trefoil design by X ray crystallography, and we report here on this protein's structure, stability, and folding behaviour. The pentafoil design misfolded into an asymmetric structure (despite a 5-fold symmetric sequence); two of the four repeat-repeat units matched the designed backbone while the other two diverged to form local contacts, leading to a trefoil rather than pentafoil knotted topology.

Nature uses photosynthetic reaction centers to convert photon energy into a cascade of electron-transfer reactions that eventually produce chemical fuel. The design of new reaction centers  de novo  deepens our understanding of photosynthetic charge separation and may one day allow production of biofuels with higher thermodynamic efficiency than natural photosystems. Recently, we described the multi-step electron-transfer activity of a designed reaction center maquette protein (the RC maquette), which can assemble metal ions, tyrosine, a Zn tetrapyrrole, and heme into an electron-transport chain. Here, we detail our modular strategy for rational protein design and show that the intended RC maquette design agrees with crystal structures in various states of assembly.

The design of new reaction centers  de novo  deepens our understanding of photosynthetic charge separation and may one day allow production of biofuels with higher thermodynamic efficiency than natural photosystems. Recently, we described the multi-step electron-transfer activity of a designed reaction center maquette protein (the RC maquette), which can assemble metal ions, tyrosine, a Zn tetrapyrrole, and heme into an electron-transport chain.

To explore this space, we developed and experimentally validated a computational platform that can design a wide variety of small protein folds while sampling shape diversity. We designed and evaluated stability of about 30,000 de novo protein designs of eight different folds. Among these designs, about 6,200 stable proteins were identified, including some predicted to have a first-of-its-kind minimalized thioredoxin fold. Obtained data revealed protein folding rules for structural features such as helix-connecting loops.

We first designed repeat proteins that sample a continuum of curvatures but have low helical rise, then docked these into C2 symmetric homodimers to generate an extensive range of C2 symmetric cavities. We used this approach to design thousands of C2 symmetric homodimers, and characterized 101 of them experimentally.

Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both.

The conformational spaces and energy landscapes of cold (unfolded) protein states, as well as the associated transitions, are hardly explored. Furthermore, it is not known how structure relates to the cooperativity of cold transitions, if cold and heat unfolded states are thermodynamically similar, and if cold states play important roles for protein function. We created the cold unfolding 4-helix bundle DCUB1 with a de novo designed bipartite hydrophilic/hydrophobic core featuring a hydrogen bond network which extends across the bundle in order to study the relative importance of hydrophobic versus hydrophilic protein-water interactions for cold unfolding. Structural and thermodynamic characterization resulted in the discovery of a complex energy landscape for cold transitions, while the heat unfolded state is a random coil. Below ∼0 °C, the core of DCUB1 disintegrates in a largely cooperative manner, while a near-native helical content is retained. The resulting cold core-unfolded state is compact and features extensive internal dynamics. Below -5 °C, two additional cold transitions are seen, that is, (i) the formation of a water-mediated, compact, and highly dynamic dimer, and (ii) the onset of cold helix unfolding decoupled from cold core unfolding.

The conformational spaces and energy landscapes of cold (unfolded) protein states, as well as the associated transitions, are hardly explored. Furthermore, it is not known how structure relates to the cooperativity of cold transitions, if cold and heat unfolded states are thermodynamically similar, and if cold states play important roles for protein function. We created the cold unfolding 4-helix bundle DCUB1 with a de novo designed bipartite hydrophilic/hydrophobic core featuring a hydrogen bond network which extends across the bundle in order to study the relative importance of hydrophobic versus hydrophilic protein-water interactions for cold unfolding. Structural and thermodynamic characterization resulted in the discovery of a complex energy landscape for cold transitions, while the heat unfolded state is a random coil. Below ∼0 °C, the core of DCUB1 disintegrates in a largely cooperative manner, while a near-native helical content is retained. The resulting cold core-unfolded state is compact and features extensive internal dynamics. Below -5 °C, two additional cold transitions are seen, that is, (i) the formation of a water-mediated, compact, and highly dynamic dimer, and (ii) the onset of cold helix unfolding decoupled from cold core unfolding. Our results suggest that cold unfolding is initiated by the intrusion of water into the hydrophilic core network and that cooperativity can be tuned by varying the number of core hydrogen bond networks.

Challenging this view, we present V3-crown directed broadly neutralizing Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (bnDs) matching the breadth of V3-base bnAbs. While most bnAbs target prefusion Env, V3-crown bnDs bind open Env conformations triggered by CD4 engagement. BnDs achieve breadth by focusing on highly conserved residues that are accessible in two distinct V3 conformations, one of which resembles CCR5-bound V3.

Here we use a high-throughput, low-fidelity assay to experimentally evaluate the stability of approximately 200,000 novel proteins. These include a wide range of sequence perturbations, providing a baseline for future work in the field. We build a neural network model that predicts protein stability given only sequences of amino acids, and compare its performance to the assayed values.

Here we investigate whether the information captured by such networks is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occurring proteins used in training the models. We generate random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting residue-residue distance maps, which, as expected, are quite featureless. We then carry out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence space, optimizing the contrast (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the inter-residue distance distributions predicted by the network and background distributions averaged over all proteins. Optimization from different random starting points resulted in novel proteins spanning a wide range of sequences and predicted structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding 129 of the network-'hallucinated' sequences, and expressed and purified the proteins in Escherichia coli; 27 of the proteins yielded monodisperse species with circular dichroism spectra consistent with the hallucinated structures. We determined the three-dimensional structures of three of the hallucinated proteins, two by X-ray crystallography and one by NMR, and these closely matched the hallucinated models.

This has mainly been due to the lack of familiarity with cryo-EM in the materials science and chemistry communities, in contrast to the fact that cryo-EM was developed as a biological technique. Nevertheless, the relatively few structures of self-assembled peptide nanotubes and ribbons solved at near-atomic resolution by cryo-EM have demonstrated that cryo-EM should be the method of choice for a structural analysis of synthetic helical filaments. In addition, cryo-EM has also demonstrated that the self-assembly of soft matter polymers has enormous potential for polymorphism, something that may be obscured by techniques such as scattering and spectroscopy.

Short sequences must encode unique target structures and avoid alternative states. However, the non-covalent forces that stabilize and discriminate between states are weak. Nonetheless, for α-helical coiled-coil assemblies considerable progress has been made in rational  de novo  design. In these, sequence repeats of nominally hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) residues,  hpphppp , direct the assembly of amphipathic helices into dimeric to tetrameric bundles. Expanding this pattern to  hpphhph  can produce larger α-helical barrels. Here, we show that pentameric to nonameric barrels are accessed by varying the residue at one of the  h  sites. In peptides with four L/I-K-E-I-A-x-Z repeats, decreasing the size of Z from threonine to serine to alanine to glycine gives progressively larger oligomers.

Here, we show that natural buried ion-pairs are stabilised by amphiphilic residues that electrostatically shield the charged motif from its surroundings to gain structural stability. To explore this effect, we build artificial proteins with buried ion-pairs by combining directed computational design and biophysical experiments. Our findings illustrate how perturbation in charged networks can introduce structural rearrangements to compensate for desolvation effects. We validate the physical principles by resolving high-resolution atomic structures of the artificial proteins that are resistant towards unfolding at extreme temperatures and harsh chemical conditions. Our findings provide a molecular understanding of functional charged networks and how point mutations may alter the protein's conformational landscape.",,"{'length_a': ['1.000'], 'length_b': ['1.000'], 'length_c': ['1.000'], 'angle_a': ['90.00'], 'angle_b': ['90.00'], 'angle_g': ['90.00']}",['SOLUTION NMR'],12929.207,

A popular enzyme fold for design attempts is the TIM barrel. This fold is a common topology for enzymes and can harbor many diverse reactions. The recent de novo design of a four-fold symmetric TIM barrel provides a well understood minimal scaffold for potential enzyme designs. Here we explore opportunities to extend and diversify this scaffold by adding a short de novo helix on top of the barrel. Due to the size of the protein, we developed a design pipeline based on computational ab initio folding that solves a less complex sub-problem focused around the helix and its vicinity and adapt it to the entire protein. We provide biochemical characterization and a high-resolution X-ray structure for one variant and compare it to our design model. The successful extension of this robust TIM-barrel scaffold opens opportunities to diversify it towards more pocket like arrangements and as such can be considered a building block for future design of binding or catalytic sites.",,"{'length_a': ['50.510'], 'length_b': ['50.510'], 'length_c': ['133.274'], 'angle_a': ['90.000'], 'angle_b': ['90.000'], 'angle_g': ['90.000']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],23526.180,

The N-terminus of the α-helix with unpaired hydrogen-bond donors was exploited as a structural motif to stabilize negatively charged tetrahedral intermediates in nucleophilic addition-elimination reactions at the acyl group. Cysteine acting as a principal catalytic residue was introduced at the second residue position of the α-helix N-terminus in a designed three-α-helix protein based on structural informatics prediction. We showed that this minimal set of functional elements is sufficient for the emergence of catalytic activity in a de novo protein. Using peptide- α thioesters as acyl-donors, we demonstrated their catalyzed amidation concomitant with hydrolysis and proved that the environment at the catalytic site critically influences the reaction outcome. These results represent a promising starting point for the development of efficient catalysts for protein labeling, conjugation, and peptide ligation.",,"{'length_a': ['26.455'], 'length_b': ['68.673'], 'length_c': ['47.258'], 'angle_a': ['90.000'], 'angle_b': ['98.230'], 'angle_g': ['90.000']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],5462.353,

However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2 . The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3 , we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder 4 , has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level.

Tumor cells often take advantage of this pathway by overexpressing the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 to evade destruction by the immune system. Alternatively, if there is a decrease in function of the PD-1 pathway, unchecked activation of the immune system and autoimmunity can result. Using a combination of computation and experiment, we designed a hyperstable 40-residue miniprotein, PD-MP1, that specifically binds murine and human PD-1 at the PD-L1 interface with a K d  of ∼100 nM. The apo crystal structure shows that the binder folds as designed with a backbone RMSD of 1.3 Å to the design model.

One domain is based on the DF (Due Ferri in Italian or two-iron in English) family of de novo proteins, which have a diiron cofactor that catalyzes a phenol oxidase reaction, while the second domain is based on PS1 (Porphyrin-binding Sequence), which binds a synthetic Zn-porphyrin (ZnP). The binding of ZnP to the original PS1 protein induces changes in structure and dynamics, which we expected to influence the catalytic rate of a fused DF domain when appropriately coupled. Both DF and PS1 are four-helix bundles, but they have distinct bundle architectures. To achieve tight coupling between the domains, they were connected by four helical linkers using a computational method to discover the most designable connections capable of spanning the two architectures. The resulting protein, DFP1 (Due Ferri Porphyrin), bound the two cofactors in the expected manner. The crystal structure of fully reconstituted DFP1 was also in excellent agreement with the design, and it showed the ZnP cofactor bound over 12 Å from the dimetal center. Next, a substrate-binding cleft leading to the diiron center was introduced into DFP1. The resulting protein acts as an allosterically modulated phenol oxidase. Its Michaelis-Menten parameters were strongly affected by the binding of ZnP, resulting in a fourfold tighter  K  m  and a 7-fold decrease in  k  cat  These studies establish the feasibility of designing allosterically regulated catalytic proteins, entirely from scratch.",,"{'length_a': ['172.478'], 'length_b': ['27.825'], 'length_c': ['188.494'], 'angle_a': ['90.00'], 'angle_b': ['117.16'], 'angle_g': ['90.00']}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],20852.682,

Antigen availability within GCs is important, as B cells must acquire and present antigen to follicular helper T cells to drive this process. However, recombinant protein immunogens such as soluble human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) trimers do not efficiently accumulate in follicles following traditional immunization. Here, we demonstrate two strategies to concentrate HIV Env immunogens in follicles, via the formation of immune complexes (ICs) or by employing self-assembling protein nanoparticles for multivalent display of Env antigens. Using rhesus macaques, we show that within a few days following immunization, free trimers were present in a diffuse pattern in draining LNs, while trimer ICs and Env nanoparticles accumulated in B cell follicles. Whole LN imaging strikingly revealed that ICs and trimer nanoparticles concentrated in as many as 500 follicles in a single LN within two days after immunization.

Antigen availability within GCs is important, as B cells must acquire and present antigen to follicular helper T cells to drive this process. However, recombinant protein immunogens such as soluble human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) trimers do not efficiently accumulate in follicles following traditional immunization. Here, we demonstrate two strategies to concentrate HIV Env immunogens in follicles, via the formation of immune complexes (ICs) or by employing self-assembling protein nanoparticles for multivalent display of Env antigens. Using rhesus macaques, we show that within a few days following immunization, free trimers were present in a diffuse pattern in draining LNs, while trimer ICs and Env nanoparticles accumulated in B cell follicles. Whole LN imaging strikingly revealed that ICs and trimer nanoparticles concentrated in as many as 500 follicles in a single LN within two days after immunization. Imaging of LNs collected seven days postimmunization showed that Env nanoparticles persisted on follicular dendritic cells in the light zone of nascent GCs.

The crystal structure of SUWA reveals an intermolecularly folded dimer with bisecting U topology, similar to the parental WA20 structure, with two long α-helices of a protomer intertwined with the helices of another protomer. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the redesigned hydrophobic core in the center of SUWA significantly suppresses the deformation of helices observed in the same region of WA20, suggesting this is a critical factor stabilizing the SUWA structure.

Addition of a cell-penetrating sequence allowed the peptides to access the cell interior and engage with their target(s), modulating signaling pathways. In Ras-driven cancer cell models, the peptides have an inhibitory effect on proliferation and show suppression of both invasion and motility.

Here, we describe a general approach for designing proteins which complement exposed polar backbone groups at the edge of beta sheets with geometrically matched beta strands. We used this approach to computationally design small proteins that bind to an exposed beta sheet on the human transferrin receptor (hTfR), which shuttles interacting proteins across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opening up avenues for drug delivery into the brain. We describe a design which binds hTfR with a 20 nM  K  d , is hyperstable, and crosses an in vitro microfluidic organ-on-a-chip model of the human BBB.
