One approach to understanding the folding code is to design a pair of proteins with maximal sequence identity but retaining different folds. Therefore, the nonidentities must be responsible for determining which fold topology prevails and constitute a fold-specific folding code. We recently designed two proteins, G(A)88 and G(B)88, with 88% sequence identity but different folds and functions [Alexander et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:11963-11968]. Here, we describe the detailed 3D structures of these proteins determined in solution by NMR spectroscopy. Despite a large number of mutations taking the sequence identity level from 16 to 88%, G(A)88 and G(B)88 maintain their distinct wild-type 3-alpha and alpha/beta folds, respectively. To our knowledge, the 3D-structure determination of two monomeric proteins with such high sequence identity but different fold topology is unprecedented.

Theoretically the mechanism involves the selective stabilization of the native structure against all other competing compact conformations in a process that involves cumulative changes in the amino acid sequence along geological timescales. Thus, an evolved protein folds into a single structure at physiological temperature, but the conformational competition remains latent. For natural proteins such competition should emerge only near cryogenic temperatures, which places it beyond experimental testing. Here, we introduce a designed monomeric miniprotein (FSD-1ss) that within biological temperatures (330-280 K) switches between simple fast folding and highly complex conformational dynamics in a structurally degenerate compact ensemble. Our findings demonstrate the physical basis for protein folding evolution in a designed protein, which exhibits poorly evolved or primordial folding.

This study involved development of a peptide to characterize the intrinsic structure of the LPA(1) GPCR second EL.

The ensemble of structures from multi-dimensional NMR experiments demonstrated that a robust coiled-coil formed without noticeable deformation due to the EL2 sequence. In contrast, the EL2 sequence showed well-defined structure only near its C-terminal residues. The NMR ensemble was combined with a computational model of the LPA(1) receptor that had previously been validated. The resulting hybrid models were evaluated using docking.

These properties are effectively controlled in enzymes that use tyrosine as a high-potential, one-electron redox cofactor. The α3Y model protein contains Y32, which can be reversibly oxidized and reduced in voltammetry measurements. Structural and kinetic properties of α3Y are presented. A solution NMR structural analysis reveals that Y32 is the most deeply buried residue in α3Y. Time-resolved spectroscopy using a soluble flash-quench generated [Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)3](3+) oxidant provides high-quality Y32-O• absorption spectra. The rate constant of Y32 oxidation (kPCET) is pH dependent: 1.4 × 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) (pH 5.5), 1.8 × 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) (pH 8.5), 5.4 × 10(3) M(-1) s(-1) (pD 5.5), and 4.0 × 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) (pD 8.5). k(H)/k(D) of Y32 oxidation is 2.5 ± 0.5 and 4.5 ± 0.9 at pH(D) 5.5 and 8.5, respectively. These pH and isotope characteristics suggest a concerted or stepwise, proton-first Y32 oxidation mechanism. The photochemical yield of Y32-O• is 28-58% versus the concentration of [Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)3](3+). Y32-O• decays slowly, t1/2 in the range of 2-10 s, at both pH 5.5 and 8.5, via radical-radical dimerization as shown by second-order kinetics and fluorescence data.

Despite accumulating evidence for the formation of TPR oligomers as an additional level of regulation there is a lack of structural and solution data explaining TPR self-association. In the present work we characterize the trimeric TPR-containing protein YbgF, which is linked to the Tol system in Gram-negative bacteria. By subtracting previously identified TPR consensus residues required for stability of the fold from residues conserved across YbgF homologs, we identified residues involved in oligomerization of the C-terminal YbgF TPR domain. Crafting these residues, which are located in loop regions between TPR motifs, onto the monomeric consensus TPR protein CTPR3 induced the formation of oligomers. The crystal structure of this engineered oligomer shows an asymmetric trimer where stacking interactions between the introduced tyrosines and displacement of the C-terminal hydrophilic capping helix, present in most TPR domains, are key to oligomerization. Asymmetric trimerization of the YbgF TPR domain and CTPR3Y3 leads to the formation of higher order oligomers both in the crystal and in solution. However, such open-ended self-association does not occur in full-length YbgF suggesting that the protein's N-terminal coiled-coil domain restricts further oligomerization. This interpretation is borne out in experiments where the coiled-coil domain of YbgF was engineered onto the N-terminus of CTPR3Y3 and shown to block self-association beyond trimerization. Our study lays the foundations for understanding the structural basis for TPR domain self-association and how such self-association can be regulated in TPR domain-containing proteins.",,"{'length_a': '62.284', 'length_b': '62.284', 'length_c': '120.368', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '90.00', 'angle_g': '120.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],14513.486,,True

This is because there are few reports of structural characterization of such systems either in their metalated or nonmetalated forms and no examples where an apo structure and the corresponding metalated peptide assembly have both been defined by X-ray crystallography. Herein we present X-ray structures of two de novo designed parallel three-stranded coiled coils (designed using the heptad repeat (a → g)) CSL9C (CS = Coil Ser) and CSL19C in their nonmetalated forms, determined to 1.36 and 2.15 A resolutions, respectively. Leucines from either position 9 (a site) or 19 (d site) are replaced by cysteine to generate the constructs CSL9C and CSL19C, respectively, yielding thiol-rich pockets at the hydrophobic interior of these peptides, suitable to bind heavy metals such as As(III), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). We use these structures to understand the inherent structural differences between a and d sites to clarify the basis of the observed differential spectroscopic behavior of metal binding in these types of peptides. Cys side chains of (CSL9C)(3) show alternate conformations and are partially preorganized for metal binding, whereas cysteines in (CSL19C)(3) are present as a single conformer. Zn(II) ions, which do not coordinate or influence Cys residues at the designed metal sites but are essential for forming X-ray quality crystals, are bound to His and Glu residues at the crystal packing interfaces of both structures. These ""apo"" structures are used to clarify the changes in metal site organization between metalated As(CSL9C)(3) and to speculate on the differential basis of Hg(II) binding in a versus d peptides. Thus, for the first time, one can establish general rules for heavy metal binding to Cys-rich sites in designed proteins which may provide insight for understanding how heavy metals bind to metallochaperones or metalloregulatory proteins.",,"{'length_a': '38.089', 'length_b': '38.089', 'length_c': '178.798', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '90.00', 'angle_g': '120.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],3327.842,,True

Although DARPins are already very stable molecules, molecular dynamics simulations, equilibrium denaturation experiments, structural studies, and recent NMR experiments suggested that the unfolding of the original C-terminal capping repeat (C-cap), taken from a natural ankyrin repeat protein, limits the stability of the initial DARPin design. Several point mutations had been introduced to optimize the C-cap and were shown to indeed further increase the stability of DARPins.

Here we report the development of highly selective inhibitors of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) family proteins. SUMOylation is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Functional differences between two major SUMO isoforms in humans, SUMO1 and SUMO2/3, are thought to arise from distinct interactions mediated by each isoform with other proteins containing SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). However, the roles of such isoform-specific interactions are largely uncharacterized due in part to the difficulty in generating high-affinity, isoform-specific inhibitors of SUMO/SIM interactions. We first determined the crystal structure of a ""monobody,"" a designed binding protein based on the fibronectin type III scaffold, bound to the yeast homolog of SUMO. This structure illustrated a mechanism by which monobodies bind to the highly conserved SIM-binding site while discriminating individual SUMO isoforms. Based on this structure, we designed a SUMO-targeted library from which we obtained monobodies that bound to the SIM-binding site of human SUMO1 with K(d) values of approximately 100 nM but bound to SUMO2 400 times more weakly.

Stacked armadillo repeats, each consisting of 42 aa arranged in three α-helices, build an elongated superhelical structure. Here, we analyzed the curvature variations in natural ArmRPs and identified a repeat pair from yeast importin-α as having the optimal curvature geometry that is complementary to a peptide over its whole length. We employed a symmetric in silico design to obtain a uniform sequence for a stackable repeat while maintaining the desired curvature geometry. Computationally designed ArmRPs (dArmRPs) had to be stabilized by mutations to remove regions of higher flexibility, which were identified by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Using an N-capping repeat from the consensus-design approach, two different crystal structures of dArmRP were determined. Although the experimental structures of dArmRP deviated from the designed curvature, the insertion of the most conserved binding pockets of natural ArmRPs onto the surface of dArmRPs resulted in binders against the expected peptide with low nanomolar affinities, similar to the binders from the consensus-design series.",,"{'length_a': '51.810', 'length_b': '68.670', 'length_c': '126.840', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '90.00', 'angle_g': '90.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],26373.705,,True

An essential unsolved question regarding this prebiotic set is whether it defines a ""foldable set""--that is, does it contain sufficient chemical information to permit cooperatively folding polypeptides? If so, what (if any) characteristic properties might such polypeptides exhibit? To investigate these questions, two ""primitive"" versions of an extant protein fold (the β-trefoil) were produced by top-down symmetric deconstruction, resulting in a reduced alphabet size of 12 or 13 amino acids and a percentage of prebiotic amino acids approaching 80%.

Ideally, such components should be highly defined and predictable in all respects of sequence, structure, stability, interactions, and function. To establish one such toolkit, here we present a basis set of de novo designed α-helical coiled-coil peptides that adopt defined and well-characterized parallel dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric states. The designs are based on sequence-to-structure relationships both from the literature and analysis of a database of known coiled-coil X-ray crystal structures. These give foreground sequences to specify the targeted oligomer state. A key feature of the design process is that sequence positions outside of these sites are considered non-essential for structural specificity; as such, they are referred to as the background, are kept non-descript, and are available for mutation as required later. Synthetic peptides were characterized in solution by circular-dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation, and their structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. Intriguingly, a hitherto widely used empirical rule-of-thumb for coiled-coil dimer specification does not hold in the designed system. However, the desired oligomeric state is achieved by database-informed redesign of that particular foreground and confirmed experimentally. We envisage that the basis set will be of use in directing and controlling protein assembly, with potential applications in chemical and synthetic biology.

We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of the Adhiron scaffold to 1.75 Å resolution revealing a compact cystatin-like fold. We have constructed a phage-display library in this scaffold by insertion of two variable peptide regions. The library is of high quality and complexity comprising 1.3 × 10(10) clones. To demonstrate library efficacy, we screened against the yeast Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO). In selected clones, variable region 1 often contained sequences homologous to the known SUMO interactive motif (V/I-X-V/I-V/I).

High-resolution crystal structural determination reveals that the designed ANK-N5C protein has a typical ankyrin fold, and the specific transcription blocker, ANK-N5C-281, forms a domain-swapped dimer.

To enhance the stability of a fibronectin type III (FN3) domain, consensus design was employed using an alignment of 2123 sequences. The resulting FN3 domain, FN3con, has unprecedented stability, with a melting temperature >100°C, a ΔG(D-N) of 15.5 kcal mol(-1) and a greatly reduced unfolding rate compared with wild-type. To determine the underlying molecular basis for stability, an X-ray crystal structure of FN3con was determined to 2.0 Å and compared with other FN3 domains of varying stabilities. The structure of FN3con reveals significantly increased salt bridge interactions that are cooperatively networked, and a highly optimized hydrophobic core. Molecular dynamics simulations of FN3con and comparison structures show the cooperative power of electrostatic and hydrophobic networks in improving FN3con stability. Taken together, our data reveal that FN3con stability does not result from a single mechanism, but rather the combination of several features and the removal of non-conserved, unfavorable interactions. The large number of sequences employed in this study has most likely enhanced the robustness of the consensus design, which is now possible due to the increased sequence availability in the post-genomic era. These studies increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern stability and demonstrate the rising potential for enhancing stability via the consensus method.",,"{'length_a': '86.100', 'length_b': '86.100', 'length_c': '86.100', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '90.00', 'angle_g': '90.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],10759.838,This sequence was generated through consensus design,True

Proteins offer an attractive target for atomic design because they can be synthesized chemically or biologically and can self-assemble. However, the generalized protein folding and design problem is unsolved. One approach to simplifying the problem is to use a repetitive protein as a scaffold. Repeat proteins are intrinsically modular, and their folding and structures are better understood than large globular domains. Here, we have developed a class of synthetic repeat proteins based on the pentapeptide repeat family of beta-solenoid proteins. We have constructed length variants of the basic scaffold and computationally designed de novo loops projecting from the scaffold core. The experimentally solved 3.56-Å resolution crystal structure of one designed loop matches closely the designed hairpin structure, showing the computational design of a backbone extension onto a synthetic protein core without the use of backbone fragments from known structures. Two other loop designs were not clearly resolved in the crystal structures, and one loop appeared to be in an incorrect conformation.

Next, we obtained crystals of Octarellin V.1 in complex with crystallization chaperons and determined the tertiary structure. The experimental structure of Octarellin V.1 differs from its in silico design: the (αβα) sandwich architecture bears some resemblance to a Rossman-like fold instead of the intended TIM-barrel fold.

However, this modularity is imperfect and also restricted to short peptide stretches of usually four to six consecutive amino acids. Here we report the development and characterization of a regularized and truly modular peptide-specific binding protein, based on designed armadillo repeat proteins (dArmRP), binding to peptides of alternating lysine and arginine residues (KR)n. dArmRP were obtained from nArmRP through cycles of extensive protein engineering, which rendered them more uniform. This regularity is reflected in the consistent binding of dArmRP to (KR)-peptides, where affinities depend on the lengths of target peptides and the number of internal repeats in a very systematic manner, thus confirming the modularity of the interaction. This exponential dependency between affinity and recognition length suggests that each module adds a constant increment of binding energy to sequence-specific recognition. This relationship was confirmed by comprehensive mutagenesis studies that also reveal the importance of individual peptide side chains. The 1.83 Å resolution crystal structure of a dArmRP with five identical internal repeats in complex with the cognate (KR)5 peptide proves a modular binding mode, where each dipeptide is recognized by one internal repeat. The confirmation of this true modularity over longer peptide stretches lays the ground for the design of binders with different specificities and tailored affinities by the assembly of dipeptide-specific modules based on armadillo repeats.",,"{'length_a': '88.830', 'length_b': '215.280', 'length_c': '105.990', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '90.00', 'angle_g': '90.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],30027.445,,True

Designs for the addition of dinuclear metal centers to four-helix bundles resulted in three artificial proteins with ligands for one, two, or three dinuclear metal centers able to bind Mn. The three-dimensional structure determined by X-ray crystallography of one of the Mn-proteins confirmed the design features and revealed details concerning coordination of the Mn center. Electron transfer between these artificial Mn-proteins and bacterial reaction centers was investigated using optical spectroscopy. After formation of a light-induced, charge-separated state, the experiments showed that the Mn-proteins can donate an electron to the oxidized bacteriochlorophyll dimer of modified reaction centers, with the Mn-proteins having additional metal centers being more effective at this electron transfer reaction. Modeling of the structure of the Mn-protein docked to the reaction center showed that the artificial protein likely binds on the periplasmic surface similarly to cytochrome c2, the natural secondary donor. Combining reaction centers with exogenous artificial proteins provides the opportunity to create ligands and investigate the influence of inhomogeneous protein environments on multinuclear redox-active metal centers.

To investigate the limits and capabilities of computational tools, we conducted a study of the ability of the program Rosetta to predict sequences that recreate the authentic fold of thioredoxin. Focusing on the influence of conformational details in the template structures, we based our study on 8 experimentally determined template structures and generated 120 designs from each. For experimental evaluation, we chose six sequences from each of the eight templates by objective criteria. The 48 selected sequences were evaluated based on their progressive ability to (1) produce soluble protein in Escherichia coli and (2) yield stable monomeric protein, and (3) on the ability of the stable, soluble proteins to adopt the target fold. Of the 48 designs, we were able to synthesize 32, 20 of which resulted in soluble protein. Of these, only two were sufficiently stable to be purified. An X-ray crystal structure was solved for one of the designs, revealing a close resemblance to the target structure. We found a significant difference among the eight template structures to realize the above three criteria despite their high structural similarity. Thus, in order to improve the success rate of computational full-sequence design methods, we recommend that multiple template structures are used.

DARPin 6G9 binds interleukin-13 with high affinity and blocks the signaling pathway and as such is promising for the treatment of asthma and other atopic diseases. The crystal structures of DARPin 6G9 in the unbound form and in complex with IL-13 were determined at high resolution. The DARPin competes for the same epitope as the IL-13 receptor chain 13Rα1 but does not interfere with the binding of the other receptor chain, IL-4Rα. Analysis of multiple copies of the DARPin molecule in the crystal indicates the conformational instability in the N-terminal cap that was predicted from molecular dynamics simulations. Comparison of the DARPin structures in the free state and in complex with IL-13 reveals a concerted movement of the ankyrin repeats upon binding resulted in the opening of the binding site. The induced-fit mode of binding employed by DARPin 6G9 is very unusual for DARPins since they were designed as particularly stable and rigid molecules.

In this context, the term ""peptide"" not only denotes a short unstructured chain of amino acids, but also an unstructured region of a protein, as they occur in termini, loops, or linkers between folded domains. Here we report two crystal structures of dArmRPs, in complex with peptides fused either to the N-terminus of Green Fluorescent Protein or to the C-terminus of a phage lambda protein D. These structures demonstrate that dArmRPs bind unfolded peptides in the intended conformation also when they constitute unstructured parts of folded proteins, which greatly expands possible applications of the dArmRP technology. Nonetheless, the structures do not fully reflect the binding behavior in solution, that is, some binding sites remain unoccupied in the crystal and even unexpected peptide residues appear to be bound. We show how these differences can be explained by restrictions of the crystal lattice or the composition of the crystallization solution. This illustrates that crystal structures have to be interpreted with caution when protein-peptide interactions are characterized, and should always be correlated with measurements in solution.",,"{'length_a': '194.660', 'length_b': '194.660', 'length_c': '241.740', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '90.00', 'angle_g': '120.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],34353.27,,True

Here we show that artificial pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins can be programmed for sequence-specific ssDNA binding. Interactions occur using the same code and specificity as for RNA binding. We solve the structures of DNA-bound and apo proteins revealing the basis for ssDNA binding and how hydrogen bond rearrangements enable the PPR structure to envelope its ssDNA target.

The ensemble of NMR structures calculated for both peptides agreed well with the design models, further confirming the accuracy of the design protocol. Collection of NMR data on the peptides under reducing conditions revealed a dependency on disulfide bonds to maintain stability. Furthermore, we performed long-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with tempering to assess the stability of two families of de novo designed peptides.

Directed evolution of the redesigned RBD improved its Ras-binding affinity to the native protein level without excessive loss of thermostability.

However, proteins of smaller size, typical of those found throughout the cell, are not presently amenable to detailed structural elucidation by cryo-EM. Here we use protein design to create a modular, symmetrical scaffolding system to make protein molecules of typical size suitable for cryo-EM. Using a rigid continuous alpha helical linker, we connect a small 17-kDa protein (DARPin) to a protein subunit that was designed to self-assemble into a cage with cubic symmetry. We show that the resulting construct is amenable to structural analysis by single-particle cryo-EM, allowing us to identify and solve the structure of the attached small protein at near-atomic detail, ranging from 3.5- to 5-Å resolution. The result demonstrates that proteins considerably smaller than the theoretical limit of 50 kDa for cryo-EM can be visualized clearly when arrayed in a rigid fashion on a symmetric designed protein scaffold.

Here we crystallographically characterize designed peptides that assemble into spiraling cross-α amyloid-like structures, which resemble twisted β-amyloid fibrils. The peptides form helical dimers, stabilized by packing of small and apolar residues, and the dimers further assemble into cross-α amyloid-like fibrils with superhelical pitches ranging from 170 Å to 200 Å. When a small residue that appeared critical for packing was converted to leucine, it resulted in structural rearrangement to a helical polymer.

Interestingly, despite significantly different first coordination spheres and nuclearity, all cupredoxins share a common Greek Key β-sheet fold. We have previously reported the design of a red copper protein within a completely distinct three-helical bundle protein, α 3 DChC2. (1) While this design demonstrated that a β-barrel fold was not requisite to recapitulate the properties of a native cupredoxin center, the parent peptide α 3 D was not sufficiently stable to allow further study through additional mutations. Here we present the design of an elongated protein GRANDα 3 D (GRα 3 D) with Δ G u  = -11.4 kcal/mol compared to the original design's -5.1 kcal/mol. Diffraction quality crystals were grown of GRα 3 D (a first for an α 3 D peptide) and solved to a resolution of 1.34 Å. Examination of this structure suggested that Glu41 might interact with the Cu in our previously reported red copper protein. The previous bis(histidine)(cysteine) site (GRα 3 DChC2) was designed into this new scaffold and a series of variant constructs were made to explore this hypothesis. Mutation studies around Glu41 not only prove the proposed interaction, but also enabled tuning of the constructs' hyperfine coupling constant from 160 to 127 × 10 -4  cm -1 . X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis is consistent with these hyperfine coupling differences being the result of variant 4p mixing related to coordination geometry changes. These studies not only prove that an Glu41-Cu interaction leads to the α 3 DChC2 construct's red copper protein like spectral properties, but also exemplify the exact control one can have in a de novo construct to tune the properties of an electron-transfer Cu site.",,"{'length_a': '46.396', 'length_b': '46.396', 'length_c': '109.303', 'angle_a': '90.000', 'angle_b': '90.000', 'angle_g': '120.000'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],10220.457,,True

Despite this potential, de novo design of all-β-sheet proteins from first principles lags far behind the design of all-α or mixed-αβ domains owing to their non-local nature and the tendency of exposed β-strand edges to aggregate. Through study of loops connecting unpaired β-strands (β-arches), we have identified a series of structural relationships between loop geometry, side chain directionality and β-strand length that arise from hydrogen bonding and packing constraints on regular β-sheet structures. We use these rules to de novo design jellyroll structures with double-stranded β-helices formed by eight antiparallel β-strands. The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of a hyperthermostable design closely matched the computational model, demonstrating accurate control over the β-sheet structure and loop geometry.

However, conformational lability of the native serpin fold renders them susceptible to misfolding and aggregation, and underlies misfolding diseases such as α 1 -antitrypsin deficiency. Serpin specificity towards its protease target is dictated by its flexible and solvent exposed reactive centre loop (RCL), which forms the initial interaction with the target protease during inhibition. Previous studies have attempted to alter the specificity by mutating the RCL to that of a target serpin, but the rules governing specificity are not understood well enough yet to enable specificity to be engineered at will. In this paper, we use conserpin, a synthetic, thermostable serpin, as a model protein with which to investigate the determinants of serpin specificity by engineering its RCL. Replacing the RCL sequence with that from α1-antitrypsin fails to restore specificity against trypsin or human neutrophil elastase. Structural determination of the RCL-engineered conserpin and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that, although the RCL sequence may partially dictate specificity, local electrostatics and RCL dynamics may dictate the rate of insertion during protease inhibition, and thus whether it behaves as an inhibitor or a substrate. Engineering serpin specificity is therefore substantially more complex than solely manipulating the RCL sequence, and will require a more thorough understanding of how conformational dynamics achieves the delicate balance between stability, folding and function required by the exquisite serpin mechanism of action.",,"{'length_a': '68.060', 'length_b': '75.280', 'length_c': '150.450', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '90.00', 'angle_g': '90.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],42741.586,,True

Pizza6 is expected to prove a useful building block for bionanotechnology, and also a tool to investigate the folding and evolution of β-propeller proteins. Folding studies are made difficult by the high stability and the lack of buried Trp residues to act as monitor fluorophores, so we have designed and characterized several Trp-containing Pizza6 derivatives.

The X-ray crystal structure of the HisAD-Cu(ii) complex reveals the trimeric HisAD peptide coordinates three Cu(ii) ions; this is the first example of such a structure.

The redesigned proteins denature with substantially higher midpoints, with the most stable variant, called Super WA20 (SUWA), displaying an extremely high midpoint ( T  m  = 122 °C), much higher than the  T  m  of WA20 (75 °C). The crystal structure of SUWA reveals an intermolecularly folded dimer with bisecting U topology, similar to the parental WA20 structure, with two long α-helices of a protomer intertwined with the helices of another protomer. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the redesigned hydrophobic core in the center of SUWA significantly suppresses the deformation of helices observed in the same region of WA20, suggesting this is a critical factor stabilizing the SUWA structure. This hyperstable  de novo  protein is expected to be useful as nanoscale pillars of PN-Block components in new types of self-assembling nanoarchitectures.",,"{'length_a': '65.636', 'length_b': '71.930', 'length_c': '81.563', 'angle_a': '90.000', 'angle_b': '90.000', 'angle_g': '90.000'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],12542.261,,True

Here we show that it is possible to form pure heterotrimeric three-stranded coiled coils by combining three distinct characteristics: (1) a cysteine sulfur layer for metal coordination, (2) a thiophilic, trigonal pyramidal metalloid (Pb(II)) that binds to these sulfurs and (3) an adjacent layer of reduced steric bulk generating a cavity where water can hydrogen bond to the cysteine sulfur atoms. Cysteine substitution in an a site yields Pb(II)A 2 B heterotrimers, while d sites provide pure Pb(II)C 2 D or Pb(II)CD 2  scaffolds. Altering the metal from Pb(II) to Hg(II) or shifting the relative position of the sterically less demanding layer removes heterotrimer specificity.

An exception is the game EteRNA 4 , in which game players learn to build new RNA structures by exploring the discrete two-dimensional space of Watson-Crick base pairing possibilities. Building new proteins, however, is a more challenging task to present in a game, as both the representation and evaluation of a protein structure are intrinsically three-dimensional. We posed the challenge of de novo protein design in the online protein-folding game Foldit 5 . Players were presented with a fully extended peptide chain and challenged to craft a folded protein structure and an amino acid sequence encoding that structure. After many iterations of player design, analysis of the top-scoring solutions and subsequent game improvement, Foldit players can now-starting from an extended polypeptide chain-generate a diversity of protein structures and sequences that encode them in silico. One hundred forty-six Foldit player designs with sequences unrelated to naturally occurring proteins were encoded in synthetic genes; 56 were found to be expressed and soluble in Escherichia coli, and to adopt stable monomeric folded structures in solution. The diversity of these structures is unprecedented in de novo protein design, representing 20 different folds-including a new fold not observed in natural proteins. High-resolution structures were determined for four of the designs, and are nearly identical to the player models. This work makes explicit the considerable implicit knowledge that contributes to success in de novo protein design, and shows that citizen scientists can discover creative new solutions to outstanding scientific challenges such as the protein design problem.",,"{'length_a': '69.210', 'length_b': '69.210', 'length_c': '90.590', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '90.00', 'angle_g': '90.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],12829.47,,True

Synthetic amphiphilic peptides have been found to form ion channels 5,6 , and there have been recent advances in de novo membrane protein design 7,8  and in redesigning naturally occurring channel-containing proteins 9,10 . However, the de novo design of stable, well-defined transmembrane protein pores that are capable of conducting ions selectively or are large enough to enable the passage of small-molecule fluorophores remains an outstanding challenge 11,12 . Here we report the computational design of protein pores formed by two concentric rings of α-helices that are stable and monodisperse in both their water-soluble and their transmembrane forms. Crystal structures of the water-soluble forms of a 12-helical pore and a 16-helical pore closely match the computational design models. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments show that, when expressed in insect cells, the transmembrane form of the 12-helix pore enables the passage of ions across the membrane with high selectivity for potassium over sodium; ion passage is blocked by specific chemical modification at the pore entrance. When incorporated into liposomes using in vitro protein synthesis, the transmembrane form of the 16-helix pore-but not the 12-helix pore-enables the passage of biotinylated Alexa Fluor 488. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 16-helix transmembrane pore closely matches the design model.

Recently, a toxic peptide was proposed to form amyloid-like cross-α structures in solution, with a planar bilayer-like assembly observed in the crystal structure. Here we crystallographically characterize designed peptides that assemble into spiraling cross-α amyloid-like structures, which resemble twisted β-amyloid fibrils. The peptides form helical dimers, stabilized by packing of small and apolar residues, and the dimers further assemble into cross-α amyloid-like fibrils with superhelical pitches ranging from 170 Å to 200 Å. When a small residue that appeared critical for packing was converted to leucine, it resulted in structural rearrangement to a helical polymer.

Significant sequence redesign was necessary to achieve the desired juxtaposition of nonpolar and cationic functionality, because we needed to eliminate charged side chains from positions flanking the nonpolar helix surface. Natural and designed sequences that form coiled coils are almost universally rich in acidic and basic residues at these flanking positions. Our arginine coiled-coil dimer was moderately more stable than the lysine analogue, which contrasts with behavior previously observed with helical β-amino acid oligomers bearing guanidinium versus ammonium groups.

We used an SQT variant with AU1 and Myc insertion peptides (SQT-1C) to study the effect of peptide insertions on protein structure and oligomerisation. The X-ray structure of monomeric SQT-1C revealed a cystatin-like fold. Furthermore, we show that SQT-1C readily forms dimers and tetramers in solution. NMR revealed that these oligomers are symmetrical, with inserted loops comprising the interaction interface. Two possible mechanisms of oligomerisation are compared using molecular dynamics simulations, with domain swap oligomerisation being thermodynamically favoured. We show that retained secondary structure upon peptide insertion is not indicative of unaltered 3D structure and solution behaviour. Therefore, additional methods should be employed to comprehensively assess the consequences of peptide insertions in all aptamers, particularly as uncharacterized oligomerisation may alter binding epitope presentation and affect functional efficiency.",,"{'length_a': '96.124', 'length_b': '96.124', 'length_c': '29.859', 'angle_a': '90.000', 'angle_b': '90.000', 'angle_g': '90.000'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],15321.174,,True

The structure of the tightest binding peptide was solved by NMR, and its binding site on Cdc42 was determined. Addition of a cell-penetrating sequence allowed the peptides to access the cell interior and engage with their target(s), modulating signaling pathways. In Ras-driven cancer cell models, the peptides have an inhibitory effect on proliferation and show suppression of both invasion and motility. As such, they represent promising candidates for Rho-family small GTPase inhibitors and therapeutics targeting Ras-driven cancers.

The consensus version recognises alternating arginines and lysines, with one dipeptide per repeat. For generating new binding specificities, the rapid and robust analysis by crystallography is key. Yet, we have previously found that crystal contacts can strongly influence this analysis, by displacing the peptide and potentially distorting the overall geometry of the scaffold. Therefore, we now used protein design to minimise these effects and expand the previously described concept of shared helices to rigidly connect dArmRPs and designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), which serve as a crystallisation chaperone. To shield the peptide-binding surface from crystal contacts, we rigidly fused two DARPins to the N- and C-terminal repeat of the dArmRP and linked the two DARPins by a disulfide bond. In this ring-like structure, peptide binding, on the inside of the ring, is very regular and undistorted, highlighting the truly modular binding mode.

The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair.

Computational design of protein nanoparticles with differing sizes and geometries enables combination with antigens of choice to test novel multimerization concepts in immunization strategies where the goal is to improve the induction and maturation of neutralizing antibody lineages. Here, we describe detailed antigenic, structural, and functional characterization of computationally designed tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticle immunogens displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomains. Env trimers, based on subtype A (BG505) or consensus group M (ConM) sequences and engineered with SOSIP stabilizing mutations, were fused to an underlying trimeric building block of each nanoparticle. Initial screening yielded one icosahedral and two tetrahedral nanoparticle candidates, capable of presenting twenty or four copies of the Env trimer. A number of analyses, including detailed structural characterization by cryo-EM, demonstrated that the nanoparticle immunogens possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties. When the immunogenicity of ConM-SOSIP trimers presented on a two-component tetrahedral nanoparticle or as soluble proteins were compared in rabbits, the two immunogens elicited similar serum antibody binding titers against the trimer component. Neutralizing antibody titers were slightly elevated in the animals given the nanoparticle immunogen and were initially more focused to the trimer apex. Altogether, our findings indicate that tetrahedral nanoparticles can be successfully applied for presentation of HIV Env trimer immunogens; however, the optimal implementation to different immunization strategies remains to be determined.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['ELECTRON MICROSCOPY'],31466.83,,True

Antigen availability within GCs is important, as B cells must acquire and present antigen to follicular helper T cells to drive this process. However, recombinant protein immunogens such as soluble human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) trimers do not efficiently accumulate in follicles following traditional immunization. Here, we demonstrate two strategies to concentrate HIV Env immunogens in follicles, via the formation of immune complexes (ICs) or by employing self-assembling protein nanoparticles for multivalent display of Env antigens. Using rhesus macaques, we show that within a few days following immunization, free trimers were present in a diffuse pattern in draining LNs, while trimer ICs and Env nanoparticles accumulated in B cell follicles. Whole LN imaging strikingly revealed that ICs and trimer nanoparticles concentrated in as many as 500 follicles in a single LN within two days after immunization. Imaging of LNs collected seven days postimmunization showed that Env nanoparticles persisted on follicular dendritic cells in the light zone of nascent GCs. These findings suggest that the form of antigen administered in vaccination can dramatically impact localization in lymphoid tissues and provides a new rationale for the enhanced immune responses observed following immunization with ICs or nanoparticles.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['ELECTRON MICROSCOPY'],14136.632,,True

Understanding and manipulating protein stability provide crucial information on the molecular determinants that modulate structure and stability, and expand the applications of de novo proteins. Since the (β/⍺) 8 -barrel or TIM-barrel fold is one of the most common functional scaffolds, in this work we designed a collection of stable de novo TIM barrels (DeNovoTIMs), using a computational fixed-backbone and modular approach based on improved hydrophobic packing of sTIM11, the first validated de novo TIM barrel, and subjected them to a thorough folding analysis. DeNovoTIMs navigate a region of the stability landscape previously uncharted by natural TIM barrels, with variations spanning 60 degrees in melting temperature and 22 kcal per mol in conformational stability throughout the designs. Significant non-additive or epistatic effects were observed when stabilizing mutations from different regions of the barrel were combined.

Molecular dynamics simulations indicate a free-energy landscape with multiple and interconverting states.

We fused two stable proteins with C2 symmetry-a de novo designed dimeric ferredoxin fold and a de novo designed TIM barrel-such that their symmetry axes are aligned to create scaffolds with large cavities that can serve as binding pockets or enzymatic reaction chambers. The crystal structures of two such designs confirm the presence of a 420 cubic Ångström chamber defined by the top of the designed TIM barrel and the bottom of the ferredoxin dimer. We functionalized the scaffold by installing a metal-binding site consisting of four glutamate residues close to the symmetry axis.

In these, sequence repeats of nominally hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) residues,  hpphppp , direct the assembly of amphipathic helices into dimeric to tetrameric bundles.

In peptides with four L/I-K-E-I-A-x-Z repeats, decreasing the size of Z from threonine to serine to alanine to glycine gives progressively larger oligomers. X-ray crystal structures of the resulting α-helical barrels rationalize this: side chains at Z point directly into the helical interfaces, and smaller residues allow closer helix contacts and larger assemblies.",,"{'length_a': '37.456', 'length_b': '50.434', 'length_c': '126.608', 'angle_a': '90.000', 'angle_b': '90.000', 'angle_g': '90.000'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],3179.818,,True

Our goal is to develop a peptide ligase for robust catalysis of amide bond formation that possesses no stringent restrictions to the amino acid composition at the ligation junction. We report here the successful completion of the first step in this long-term project by building a completely de novo protein with predefined acyl transfer catalytic activity. We applied a minimalist approach to rationally design an oxyanion hole within a small cavity that contains an adjacent thiol nucleophile. The N-terminus of the α-helix with unpaired hydrogen-bond donors was exploited as a structural motif to stabilize negatively charged tetrahedral intermediates in nucleophilic addition-elimination reactions at the acyl group. Cysteine acting as a principal catalytic residue was introduced at the second residue position of the α-helix N-terminus in a designed three-α-helix protein based on structural informatics prediction. We showed that this minimal set of functional elements is sufficient for the emergence of catalytic activity in a de novo protein. Using peptide- α thioesters as acyl-donors, we demonstrated their catalyzed amidation concomitant with hydrolysis and proved that the environment at the catalytic site critically influences the reaction outcome. These results represent a promising starting point for the development of efficient catalysts for protein labeling, conjugation, and peptide ligation.",,"{'length_a': '26.455', 'length_b': '68.673', 'length_c': '47.258', 'angle_a': '90.000', 'angle_b': '98.230', 'angle_g': '90.000'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],5462.353,,True

However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2 . The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3 , we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder 4 , has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.",,"{'length_a': '178.993', 'length_b': '60.127', 'length_c': '71.799', 'angle_a': '90.000', 'angle_b': '112.460', 'angle_g': '90.000'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],36162.277,,True

One domain is based on the DF (Due Ferri in Italian or two-iron in English) family of de novo proteins, which have a diiron cofactor that catalyzes a phenol oxidase reaction, while the second domain is based on PS1 (Porphyrin-binding Sequence), which binds a synthetic Zn-porphyrin (ZnP). The binding of ZnP to the original PS1 protein induces changes in structure and dynamics, which we expected to influence the catalytic rate of a fused DF domain when appropriately coupled. Both DF and PS1 are four-helix bundles, but they have distinct bundle architectures. To achieve tight coupling between the domains, they were connected by four helical linkers using a computational method to discover the most designable connections capable of spanning the two architectures. The resulting protein, DFP1 (Due Ferri Porphyrin), bound the two cofactors in the expected manner. The crystal structure of fully reconstituted DFP1 was also in excellent agreement with the design, and it showed the ZnP cofactor bound over 12 Å from the dimetal center. Next, a substrate-binding cleft leading to the diiron center was introduced into DFP1. The resulting protein acts as an allosterically modulated phenol oxidase. Its Michaelis-Menten parameters were strongly affected by the binding of ZnP, resulting in a fourfold tighter  K  m  and a 7-fold decrease in  k  cat  These studies establish the feasibility of designing allosterically regulated catalytic proteins, entirely from scratch.",,"{'length_a': '172.478', 'length_b': '27.825', 'length_c': '188.494', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '117.16', 'angle_g': '90.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],20852.682,,True

Here we investigate whether the information captured by such networks is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occurring proteins used in training the models. We generate random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting residue-residue distance maps, which, as expected, are quite featureless. We then carry out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence space, optimizing the contrast (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the inter-residue distance distributions predicted by the network and background distributions averaged over all proteins.

Furthermore, small structural variations in a single fold, sometimes only a few amino acids, can define a protein's molecular function.

To explore this space, we developed and experimentally validated a computational platform that can design a wide variety of small protein folds while sampling shape diversity. We designed and evaluated stability of about 30,000 de novo protein designs of eight different folds. Among these designs, about 6,200 stable proteins were identified, including some predicted to have a first-of-its-kind minimalized thioredoxin fold. Obtained data revealed protein folding rules for structural features such as helix-connecting loops.

Thus, deep networks trained to predict native protein structures from their sequences can be inverted to design new proteins, and such networks and methods should contribute alongside traditional physics-based models to the de novo design of proteins with new functions.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['SOLUTION NMR'],11474.791,,True

Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both.

De novo protein design can readily address these challenges. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a topological refactoring strategy to design novel granulopoietic proteins starting from the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) structure. We change a protein fold by rearranging the sequence and optimising it towards the new fold. Testing four designs, we obtain two that possess nanomolar activity, the most active of which is highly thermostable and protease-resistant, and matches its designed structure to atomic accuracy. While the designs possess starkly different sequence and structure from the native G-CSF, they show specific activity in differentiating primary human haematopoietic stem cells into mature neutrophils. The designs also show significant and specific activity in vivo. Our topological refactoring approach is largely independent of sequence or structural context, and is therefore applicable to a wide range of protein targets.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['SOLUTION NMR'],13014.956,,True

This has mainly been due to the lack of familiarity with cryo-EM in the materials science and chemistry communities, in contrast to the fact that cryo-EM was developed as a biological technique. Nevertheless, the relatively few structures of self-assembled peptide nanotubes and ribbons solved at near-atomic resolution by cryo-EM have demonstrated that cryo-EM should be the method of choice for a structural analysis of synthetic helical filaments. In addition, cryo-EM has also demonstrated that the self-assembly of soft matter polymers has enormous potential for polymorphism, something that may be obscured by techniques such as scattering and spectroscopy.

Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both.

The TIM barrel fold is an important target for these efforts as it is highly enriched for diverse functions in nature. Although a TIM barrel protein has been designed de novo, the ability to finely alter the curvature of the central beta barrel and the overall architecture of the fold remains elusive, limiting its utility for functional design. Here, we report the de novo design of a TIM barrel with ovoid (twofold) symmetry, drawing inspiration from natural beta and TIM barrels with ovoid curvature. We use an autoregressive backbone sampling strategy to implement our hypothesis for elongated barrel curvature, followed by an iterative enrichment sequence design protocol to obtain sequences which yield a high proportion of successfully folding designs. Designed sequences are highly stable and fold to the designed barrel curvature as determined by a 2.1 Å resolution crystal structure. The designs show robustness to drastic mutations, retaining high melting temperatures even when multiple charged residues are buried in the hydrophobic core or when the hydrophobic core is ablated to alanine. As a scaffold with a greater capacity for hosting diverse hydrogen bonding networks and installation of binding pockets or active sites, the ovoid TIM barrel represents a major step towards the de novo design of functional TIM barrels.",,"{'length_a': '44.848', 'length_b': '65.526', 'length_c': '77.686', 'angle_a': '90.000', 'angle_b': '90.000', 'angle_g': '90.000'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],28003.379,,True

One promising approach to addressing this challenge is the design of metal-dependent associating proteins. Such designed proteins typically have Cys or His residues at the protein surface for connecting the associating proteins through metal-ion coordination. However, Cys and His residues favor interactions with soft and borderline metal ions, such as Au +  and Zn 2+ , classified by the hard and soft acids and bases concept, restricting the types of metal ions available to drive association. Here, we show the alkaline earth (AE) metal-dependent association of the recently designed artificial protein nanocage TIP60, which is composed of 60-mer fusion proteins. The introduction of a Glu (hard base) mutation to the fusion protein (K67E mutant) prevented the formation of the 60-mer but formed the expected cage structure in the presence of Ca, Sr, or Ba ions (hard acids). Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis indicated a Ba ion at the interface of the subunits.

In place of hundreds of complex, membrane-bound G-protein coupled receptors, differential sensors employ arrays of small molecules. Here we show that arrays of computationally designed de novo peptides provide alternative synthetic receptors for differential sensing. We use self-assembling α-helical barrels (αHBs) with central channels that can be altered predictably to vary their sizes, shapes and chemistries. The channels accommodate environment-sensitive dyes that fluoresce upon binding. Challenging arrays of dye-loaded barrels with analytes causes differential fluorophore displacement. The resulting fluorimetric fingerprints are used to train machine-learning models that relate the patterns to the analytes. We show that this system discriminates between a range of biomolecules, drink, and diagnostically relevant biological samples.

However, their success has been limited by the naturally occurring structure of the immunoglobulin dimer displaying hypervariable binding loops, which is hard to modify by traditional engineering approaches. Here, we devise geometrical principles for de novo designing single-chain immunoglobulin dimers, as a tunable two-domain architecture that optimizes biophysical properties through more favorable dimer interfaces. Guided by these principles, we computationally designed protein scaffolds that were hyperstable, structurally accurate and robust for accommodating multiple functional loops, both individually and in combination, as confirmed through biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography. We showcase the modularity of this architecture by deep-learning-based diversification, opening up the possibility for tailoring the number, positioning, and relative orientation of ligand-binding loops targeting one or two distal epitopes.

We hypothesized that replacement of terminal inter-β-strand hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) may lead to conformationally-defined macrocyclic β-sheets without the requirement for natural or synthetic β-turns, thereby providing a minimal mimic of a protein β-sheet. To access turn-less antiparallel β-sheet mimics, we developed a facile solid phase synthesis protocol. We surveyed a dataset of protein β-sheets for naturally observed interstrand side chain interactions. This bioinformatics survey highlighted an over-abundance of aromatic-aromatic, cation-π and ionic interactions in β-sheets. In correspondence with natural β-sheets, we find that minimal HBS mimics show robust β-sheet formation when specific amino acid residue pairings are incorporated. In isolated β-sheets, aromatic interactions endow superior conformational stability over ionic or cation-π interactions.

Here, we design IL-4 cytokine mimetics (denoted Neo-4) based on a de novo engineered IL-2 mimetic scaffold and demonstrate that these cytokines can recapitulate physiological functions of IL-4 in cellular and animal models. In contrast with natural IL-4, Neo-4 is hyperstable and signals exclusively through the type I IL-4 receptor complex, providing previously inaccessible insights into differential IL-4 signaling through type I versus type II receptors. Because of their hyperstability, our computationally designed mimetics can directly incorporate into sophisticated biomaterials that require heat processing, such as three-dimensional-printed scaffolds.

These methods largely focus on optimizing the compatibility between the designed sequence and the intended conformation, without explicit consideration of protein folding pathways. Deeply knotted proteins, whose topologies may introduce substantial barriers to folding, thus represent an interesting test case for protein design. Here we report our attempts to design proteins with trefoil (3 1 ) and pentafoil (5 1 ) knotted topologies. We extended previously described algorithms for tandem repeat protein design in order to construct deeply knotted backbones and matching designed repeat sequences (N = 3 repeats for the trefoil and N = 5 for the pentafoil). We confirmed the intended conformation for the trefoil design by X ray crystallography, and we report here on this protein's structure, stability, and folding behaviour. The pentafoil design misfolded into an asymmetric structure (despite a 5-fold symmetric sequence); two of the four repeat-repeat units matched the designed backbone while the other two diverged to form local contacts, leading to a trefoil rather than pentafoil knotted topology. Our results also provide insights into the folding of knotted proteins.",,"{'length_a': '59.589', 'length_b': '59.589', 'length_c': '178.211', 'angle_a': '90.000', 'angle_b': '90.000', 'angle_g': '90.000'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],35934.645,,True

Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100 µm three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",,"{'length_a': '234.241', 'length_b': '234.241', 'length_c': '234.241', 'angle_a': '90.000', 'angle_b': '90.000', 'angle_g': '90.000'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],16107.591,,True

The corresponding target recognition mechanisms are mostly elusive because of challenges in performing detailed structural analysis of highly dynamic IDP-IDP complexes. Here, we show that by combining recently developed computational approaches with experiments, the structure of the complex between the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of protein 4.1G and its target IDP region in NuMA can be dissected at high resolution. First, we carry out systematic mutational scanning using dihydrofolate reductase-based protein complementarity analysis to identify essential interaction regions and key residues. The results are found to be highly consistent with an α/β-type complex structure predicted by AlphaFold2 (AF2). We then design mutants based on the predicted structure using a deep learning protein sequence design method. The solved crystal structure of one mutant presents the same core structure as predicted by AF2. Further computational prediction and experimental assessment indicate that the well-defined core structure is conserved across complexes of 4.1G CTD with other potential targets.

Here we report the crystal structure of a single-chain CCPO in the shape of a triangle. While neither cyclization nor the addition of nanobodies enabled crystallization, it was ultimately facilitated by the inclusion of a GCN 2  homodimer. Triangle edges are formed by the orthogonal parallel coiled-coil dimers P1:P2, P3:P4, and GCN 2  connected by short linkers. A triangle has a large central cavity and is additionally stabilized by side-chain interactions between neighboring segments at each vertex. The crystal lattice is densely packed and stabilized by a large number of contacts between triangles. Interestingly, the polypeptide chain folds into a trefoil-type protein knot topology, and AlphaFold2 fails to predict the correct fold. The structure validates the modular CC-based protein design strategy, providing molecular insight underlying CCPO stabilization and new opportunities for the design.",,"{'length_a': '33.840', 'length_b': '36.980', 'length_c': '44.670', 'angle_a': '97.25', 'angle_b': '105.76', 'angle_g': '95.45'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],24220.041,,True

Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100 µm three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['ELECTRON MICROSCOPY'],8766.459,,True

Accessing this potential has been challenging for both computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to have functions. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences, and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical properties.

Accessing this potential has been challenging for both computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to have functions. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences, and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical properties. The crystal structures of two designed proteins exhibit atomistic agreement with Chroma samples (a backbone root-mean-square deviation of around 1.0 Å).

Most existing models for de novo peptide design are largely based on sequence homology that can be restricted based on evolutionarily derived protein sequences and lack the physicochemical context essential in protein folding. Generative machine learning for de novo peptide design is a promising way to synthesize theoretical data that are based on, but unique from, the observable universe. In this study, we created and tested a custom peptide generative adversarial network intended to design peptide sequences that can fold into the β-hairpin secondary structure. This deep neural network model is designed to establish a preliminary foundation of the generative approach based on physicochemical and conformational properties of 20 canonical amino acids, for example, hydrophobicity and residue volume, using extant structure-specific sequence data from the PDB. The beta generative adversarial network model robustly distinguishes secondary structures of β hairpin from α helix and intrinsically disordered peptides with an accuracy of up to 96% and generates artificial β-hairpin peptide sequences with minimum sequence identities around 31% and 50% when compared against the current NCBI PDB and nonredundant databases, respectively. These results highlight the potential of generative models specifically anchored by physicochemical and conformational property features of amino acids to expand the sequence-to-structure landscape of proteins beyond evolutionary limits.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['SOLUTION NMR'],1747.884,,True

The crystal structure of MID1-zinc shows good overall agreement with the computational model, but only three out of four designed histidines coordinate zinc.

Thus, they may form the basis for building a modular system, in which each repeat is complementary to a piece of the target peptide. Accordingly, preselected repeats could be assembled into specific binding proteins on demand and thereby avoid the traditional generation of every new binding molecule by an independent selection from a library. Stacked armadillo repeats, each consisting of 42 aa arranged in three α-helices, build an elongated superhelical structure. Here, we analyzed the curvature variations in natural ArmRPs and identified a repeat pair from yeast importin-α as having the optimal curvature geometry that is complementary to a peptide over its whole length. We employed a symmetric in silico design to obtain a uniform sequence for a stackable repeat while maintaining the desired curvature geometry. Computationally designed ArmRPs (dArmRPs) had to be stabilized by mutations to remove regions of higher flexibility, which were identified by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Using an N-capping repeat from the consensus-design approach, two different crystal structures of dArmRP were determined.

We design proteins with idealized serine-containing catalytic triads and assess their nucleophilicity directly in native biological systems using activity-based organophosphate probes. Crystal structures of the most successful designs show unprecedented agreement with computational models, including extensive hydrogen bonding networks between the catalytic triad (or quartet) residues, and mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that these networks are critical for serine activation and organophosphate reactivity.

DARPin 6G9 binds interleukin-13 with high affinity and blocks the signaling pathway and as such is promising for the treatment of asthma and other atopic diseases. The crystal structures of DARPin 6G9 in the unbound form and in complex with IL-13 were determined at high resolution. The DARPin competes for the same epitope as the IL-13 receptor chain 13Rα1 but does not interfere with the binding of the other receptor chain, IL-4Rα. Analysis of multiple copies of the DARPin molecule in the crystal indicates the conformational instability in the N-terminal cap that was predicted from molecular dynamics simulations. Comparison of the DARPin structures in the free state and in complex with IL-13 reveals a concerted movement of the ankyrin repeats upon binding resulted in the opening of the binding site. The induced-fit mode of binding employed by DARPin 6G9 is very unusual for DARPins since they were designed as particularly stable and rigid molecules.

In humans, the family of β-defensins plays a pivotal role in innate immunity. Two human β-defensins, β-defensin-2 and -3 (HBD2 and HBD3), show substantial sequence identity and structural similarity. However, HBD3 kills Staphylococcus (S.) aureus with a 4- to 8-fold higher efficiency compared to HBD2, whereas their activities against Escherichia (E.) coli are very similar. The generation of six HBD2/HBD3-chimeric molecules led to the identification of distinct molecular regions which mediate their divergent killing properties. One of the chimeras (chimera C3) killed both E. coli and S. aureus with an even higher efficacy compared to the wild-type molecules. Due to the broad spectrum of its antimicrobial activity against many human multidrug-resistant pathogens, this HBD2/HBD3-chimeric peptide represents a promising candidate for a new class of antibiotics. In order to investigate the structural basis of its exceptional antimicrobial activity, the peptide's tertiary structure was determined by NMR spectroscopy, which allowed its direct comparison to the published structures of HBD2 and HBD3 and the identification of the activity-increasing molecular features.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['SOLUTION NMR'],4982.063,,True

A computational method for generating innovative membrane-pore-forming peptides inspired by natural templates is presented. Peptide representation in terms of sequence- and topology-dependent hydrophobic moments is introduced. This design concept proves to be appropriate for the de novo generation of first-in-class membrane-active peptides with the anticipated mode of action. The designed peptides outperform the natural template in terms of their antibacterial activity. They form a kinked helical structure and self-assemble in the membrane by an entropy-driven mechanism to form dynamically growing pores that are dependent on the lipid composition. The results of this study demonstrate the unique potential of natural template-based peptide design for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.,,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['SOLUTION NMR'],2249.718,,True

Efficient viral targeting to a tissue of choice requires both ablation of the virus' original tropism and engineering of an efficient receptor-mediated uptake by a specific cell population. We have developed a series of adapters binding to the virus with such high affinity that they remain fully bound for >10 d, block its natural receptor binding site and mediate interaction with a surface receptor of choice. The adapter contains two fused modules, both consisting of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), one binding to the fiber knob of adenovirus serotype 5 and the other binding to various tumor markers. By solving the crystal structure of the complex of the trimeric knob with three bound DARPins at 1.95-Å resolution, we could use computer modeling to design a link to a trimeric protein of extraordinary kinetic stability, the capsid protein SHP from the lambdoid phage 21. We arrived at a module which binds the knob like a trimeric clamp. When this clamp was fused with DARPins of varying specificities, it enabled adenovirus serotype 5-mediated delivery of a transgene in a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-, epidermal growth factor receptor-, or epithelial cell adhesion molecule-dependent manner with transduction efficiencies comparable to or even exceeding those of Ad itself. With these adapters, efficiently produced in Escherichia coli, Ad can be converted rapidly to new receptor specificities using any ligand as the receptor-binding moiety. Prefabricated Ads with different payloads thus can be retargeted readily to many cell types of choice.",,"{'length_a': '109.600', 'length_b': '112.100', 'length_c': '129.670', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '90.00', 'angle_g': '90.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],21894.42,,True

We have now assembled a large optimized αRep library. In this library, the side chains at each variable position are not fully randomized but instead encoded by a distribution of codons based on the natural frequency of side chains of the natural repeats family. The library construction is based on a polymerization of micro-genes and therefore results in a distribution of proteins with a variable number of repeats. We improved the library construction process using a ""filtration"" procedure to retain only fully coding modules that were recombined to recreate sequence diversity. The final library named Lib2.1 contains 1.7×10(9) independent clones. Here, we used phage display to select, from the previously described library or from the new library, new specific αRep proteins binding to four different non-related predefined protein targets. Specific binders were selected in each case. The results show that binders with various sizes are selected including relatively long sequences, with up to 7 repeats. ITC-measured affinities vary with Kd values ranging from micromolar to nanomolar ranges. The formation of complexes is associated with a significant thermal stabilization of the bound target protein. The crystal structures of two complexes between αRep and their cognate targets were solved and show that the new interfaces are established by the variable surfaces of the repeated modules, as well by the variable N-cap residues.

Currently available methods for creating rigid protein assemblies rely on either complicated calculations or extensive trial and error. We describe a simple and efficient method for connecting two proteins via a fused alpha helix that is formed by joining two preexisting helices into a single extended helix. Because the end-to-end ligation of helices does not guarantee the formation of a continuous helix, we superimposed 1-2 turns of pairs of connecting helices by using a molecular graphics program. Then, we chose amino acids from the two natural sequences that would stabilize the connecting helix. This ""shared helix method"" is highly efficient. All the designed proteins that could be produced in Escherichia coli were readily crystallized and had the expected fusion structures. To prove the usefulness of this method, we produced two novel repeat proteins by assembling several copies of natural or artificial proteins with alpha helices at both termini. Their crystal structures demonstrated the successful assembly of the repeating units with the intended curved shapes. We propose that this method could dramatically expand the available repertoire of natural repeat proteins.",,"{'length_a': '48.658', 'length_b': '75.528', 'length_c': '80.013', 'angle_a': '84.19', 'angle_b': '83.72', 'angle_g': '75.21'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],45366.309,,True

VG13P displays an enhanced anti-endotoxin property as evident from significant reduction in LPS-induced TNF-α gene expression levels in a monocytic cell line, while it retains almost unchanged antimicrobial activity as its parent VG16KRKP against Gram-negative bacterial as well as fungal pathogens. In addition, in vitro LPS binding properties of VG13P in comparison to its parent VG16KRKP also remained unhindered, suggesting that the flexible C-terminal end of VG16KRKP may not play a major role in its observed antibacterial and LPS binding properties. An NMR-resolved solution structure of VG13P in LPS reveals two consecutive β-turns: one at the N-terminus, followed by another at the central region, closely resembling a rocking chair. The crucial Lys6Gly mutation along with C-terminal truncation from VG16KRKP reorients the hydrophobic hub in VG13P in a unique way so as to fold the N-terminal end back on itself, forming a turn and allowing Val1 and Ala2 to interact with Leu11 and Phe12 to bring the hydrophobic residues closer together to form a more compact hub compared to its parent. The hub is further strengthened via CH-π interaction between Gly4 and Phe12. This accounts for its improved anti-endotoxin activity as well as to its uninterrupted antimicrobial activity.",,"{'length_a': '', 'length_b': '', 'length_c': '', 'angle_a': '', 'angle_b': '', 'angle_g': ''}",['SOLUTION NMR'],1449.745,,True

We have now assembled a large optimized αRep library. In this library, the side chains at each variable position are not fully randomized but instead encoded by a distribution of codons based on the natural frequency of side chains of the natural repeats family. The library construction is based on a polymerization of micro-genes and therefore results in a distribution of proteins with a variable number of repeats. We improved the library construction process using a ""filtration"" procedure to retain only fully coding modules that were recombined to recreate sequence diversity. The final library named Lib2.1 contains 1.7×10(9) independent clones. Here, we used phage display to select, from the previously described library or from the new library, new specific αRep proteins binding to four different non-related predefined protein targets. Specific binders were selected in each case. The results show that binders with various sizes are selected including relatively long sequences, with up to 7 repeats. ITC-measured affinities vary with Kd values ranging from micromolar to nanomolar ranges. The formation of complexes is associated with a significant thermal stabilization of the bound target protein. The crystal structures of two complexes between αRep and their cognate targets were solved and show that the new interfaces are established by the variable surfaces of the repeated modules, as well by the variable N-cap residues. These results suggest that αRep library is a new and versatile source of tight and specific binding proteins with favorable biophysical properties.",,"{'length_a': '118.210', 'length_b': '59.210', 'length_c': '65.530', 'angle_a': '90.00', 'angle_b': '90.00', 'angle_g': '90.00'}",['X-RAY DIFFRACTION'],12196.199,,True
