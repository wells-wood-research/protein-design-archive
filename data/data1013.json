        "abstract":"A 12-residue peptide designed to form an alpha-helix and self-associate into an antiparallel 4-alpha-helical bundle yields a 0.9 A crystal structure revealing unanticipated features. The structure was determined by direct phasing with the \"Shake-and-Bake\" program, and contains four crystallographically distinct 12-mer peptide molecules plus solvent for a total of 479 atoms. The crystal is formed from nearly ideal alpha-helices hydrogen bonded head-to-tail into columns, which in turn pack side-by-side into sheets spanning the width of the crystal. Within each sheet, the alpha-helices run antiparallel and are closely spaced (9-10 A center-to-center). The sheets are more loosely packed against each other (13-14 A between helix centers). Each sheet is amphiphilic: apolar leucine side chains project from one face, charged lysine and glutamate side chains from the other face. The sheets are stacked with two polar faces opposing and two apolar faces opposing. The result is a periodic biomaterial composed of packed protein bilayers, with alternating polar and apolar interfaces. All of the 30 water molecules in the unit cell lie in the polar interface or between the stacked termini of helices. A section through the sheet reveals that the helices packed at the apolar interface resemble the four-alpha-helical bundle of the design, but the helices overhang parts of the adjacent bundles, and the helix crossing angles are less steep than intended (7-11 degrees rather than 18 degrees).",

        "abstract":"Contryphan-R, from venom of the cone-shell Conus radiatus, represents a novel cyclic peptide scaffold onto which residues may be grafted to mimic unrelated protein surfaces. Three substitutions were made at the x and X positions of the disulfide-bridged motif CPxXPXC, where X and x represent any L- and D-handed residues, respectively, P represents proline or hydroxyproline, and C a half-cystine. These substitutions were designed to mimic part of the pharmacophore of the unrelated globular polypeptide omega-conotoxin GVIA, which blocks N-type calcium channels. The structure of this engineered contryphan, YNK-contryphan-R ([D-Tyr4, Asn5, Lys7]contryphan-R), is shown to be similar to that of native contryphan-R (Pallaghy et al., Biochemistry, 1999, Vol. 38, pp. 13553-13559), confirming that the scaffold is robust with respect to the multiple substitutions. In particular, the alpha-beta bond vectors characterising the orientation of the side chains relative to the backbone are similar in contryphan-R, YNK-contryphan-R, and omega-conotoxin GVIA, which is the required result for a scaffold-based approach to molecular design. The solution structure of YNK-contryphan-R has an N-terminal, nonhydrogen-bonded, chain reversal centered on Hyp3-D-Trp4, and a C-terminal type I beta-turn. A minor form due to cis-trans isomerism of the Hyp2-Cys3 peptide bond is present in YNK-contryphan-R in a larger proportion than in contryphan-R. It is evident, particularly from the (3)J(HalphaHN) coupling constants, that YNK-contryphan-R is more flexible than contryphan-R, probably due to the absence in YNK-contryphan-R of the Pro-Trp packing present in the native molecule. Nevertheless, the structure confirms that cyclic peptide molecular designs can achieve the intended conformations.",

The structural roles of conserved residues have been studied using site-directed mutagenesis of both wild type domains. Crucial interactions responsible for the stability of the WW structure have been identified. Based on a network of highly conserved long range interactions across the beta-sheet structure that supports the WW fold and on a systematic analysis of conserved residues in the WW family, we have designed a folded prototype WW sequence.",

Here we describe the de novo design and characterization of a two heptad-repeat peptide stabilized by a complex network of inter- and intrahelical salt bridges. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation show that this peptide is highly alpha-helical and 100% dimeric tinder physiological buffer conditions. Interestingly, the peptide was shown to switch its oligomerization state from a dimer to a trimer upon increasing ionic strength. The correctness of the rational design principles used here is supported by details of the atomic structure of the peptide deduced from X-ray crystallography. The structure of the peptide shows that it is not a molten globule but assumes a unique, native-like conformation. This de novo peptide thus represents an attractive model system for the design of a molecular recognition system.",

We show that all peptides are highly alpha-helical and two of them are 100% dimeric under physiological conditions. Furthermore, we have solved the X-ray structure of the most stable of these peptides and the rational design principles are verified by comparing this structure to the structure of the parent peptide. We show that by combining the most favorable inter- and intrahelical salt-bridge arrangements it is possible to design coiled-coil oligomerization domains with improved stability properties.",

We have recently de novo designed and optimized a series of two-heptad repeat long coiled-coil peptides which are further stabilized by a complex network of inter- and intrahelical salt bridges. Here we have extended the de novo design of such two heptad-repeat long peptides by removing the central and most important g-e' Arg to Glu (g-e'RE) ionic interhelical interaction and replacing these residues by alanine residues. The effect of the missing interhelical ionic interaction on coiled-coil formation and stability has been analyzed by CD spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and X-ray crystallography. We show that the peptide, while being highly alpha-helical, is no longer able to form a parallel coiled-coil structure but rather assumes an octameric globular helical assembly devoid of any coiled-coil interactions.",

However, the designed AR protein E3_19 exhibits a significantly lower stability than E3_5 (9.6 vs. 14.8 kcal\/mol), despite 88% sequence identity. To investigate the structural correlations of this stability difference between E3_5 and E3_19, we determined the crystal structure of E3_19 at 1.9 A resolution. E3_19 as well has a regular AR domain fold with the characteristic H-bonding patterns. All structural features of the E3_5 and E3_19 molecules appear to be virtually identical (RMSD(Calpha) approximately 0.7 A). However, clear differences are observed in the surface charge distribution of the two AR proteins. E3_19 features clusters of charged residues and more exposed hydrophobic residues than E3_5. The atomic coordinates of E3_19 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. PDB ID: 2BKG.",

        "abstract":"Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) are a novel class of binding molecules, which can be selected to recognize specifically a wide variety of target proteins. DARPins were previously selected against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) with low nanomolar affinities. We describe here their affinity maturation by error-prone PCR and ribosome display yielding clones with zero to seven (average 2.5) amino acid substitutions in framework positions. The DARPin with highest affinity (90 pM) carried four mutations at framework positions, leading to a 3000-fold affinity increase compared to the consensus framework variant, mainly coming from a 500-fold increase of the on-rate. This DARPin was found to be highly sensitive in detecting Her2 in human carcinoma extracts. We have determined the crystal structure of this DARPin at 1.7 A, and found that a His to Tyr mutation at the framework position 52 alters the inter-repeat H-bonding pattern and causes a significant conformational change in the relative disposition of the repeat subdomains. These changes are thought to be the reason for the enhanced on-rate of the mutated DARPin. The DARPin not bearing the residue 52 mutation has an unusually slow on-rate, suggesting that binding occurred via conformational selection of a relatively rare state, which was stabilized by this His52Tyr mutation, increasing the on-rate again to typical values. An analysis of the structural location of the framework mutations suggests that randomization of some framework residues either by error-prone PCR or by design in a future library could increase affinities and the target binding spectrum.",

Despite arsenic's health impact, there is relatively little structural detail known about its interactions with proteins. Bacteria such as Escherichia coli have evolved arsenic resistance using the Ars operon that is regulated by ArsR, a repressor protein that dissociates from DNA when As(III) binds. This protein undergoes a critical conformational change upon binding As(III) with three cysteine residues. Unfortunately, structures of ArsR with or without As(III) have not been reported. Alternatively, de novo designed peptides can bind As(III) in an endo configuration within a thiolate-rich environment consistent with that proposed for both ArsR and ArsD. We report the structure of the As(III) complex of Coil Ser L9C to a 1.8-A resolution, providing x-ray characterization of As(III) in a Tris thiolate protein environment and allowing a structural basis by which to understand arsenated ArsR.",

        "abstract":"The Trp-cage, as the smallest miniprotein, remains the subject of numerous computational and experimental studies of protein folding dynamics and pathways. The original Trp-cage (NLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS, Tm = 42 degrees C) can be significantly stabilized by mutations; melting points as high as 64 degrees C are reported. In helical portions of the structure, each allowed replacement of Leu, Ile, Lys or Ser residues by Ala results in a 1.5 (+\/-0.35) kJ\/mol fold stabilization. No changes in structure or fluxionality of the core results upon stabilization. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, specific Pro\/Trp interactions are not essential for core formation. The entropic advantage of Pro versus Ala (DeltaDeltaS(U) = 11 +\/- 2 J\/mol K) was measured at the solvent-exposed P17 site. Pro-Ala mutations at two of the three prolines (P12 and P18) that encage the indole ring result in less fold destabilization (2.3-3.4 kJ\/mol). However, a P19A mutation reduces fold stability by 16 kJ\/mol reflecting a favorable Y3\/P19 interaction as well as Trp burial. The Y3\/P19 hydrophobic staple interaction defines the folding motif as an 18-residue unit. Other stabilizing features that have been identified include a solvent-exposed Arg\/Asp salt bridge (3.4-6 kJ\/mol) and a buried H-bonded Ser side chain ( approximately 10 kJ\/mol).",

        "abstract":"How do proteins accomplish folding during early evolution? Theoretically the mechanism involves the selective stabilization of the native structure against all other competing compact conformations in a process that involves cumulative changes in the amino acid sequence along geological timescales. Thus, an evolved protein folds into a single structure at physiological temperature, but the conformational competition remains latent. For natural proteins such competition should emerge only near cryogenic temperatures, which places it beyond experimental testing. Here, we introduce a designed monomeric miniprotein (FSD-1ss) that within biological temperatures (330-280 K) switches between simple fast folding and highly complex conformational dynamics in a structurally degenerate compact ensemble. Our findings demonstrate the physical basis for protein folding evolution in a designed protein, which exhibits poorly evolved or primordial folding. Furthermore, these results open the door to the experimental exploration of primitive folding and the switching between alternative protein structures that takes place in evolutionary branching points and prion diseases, as well as the benchmarking of de novo design methods.",

The bilayer association of the peptides has been shown to be strongly pH-dependent, with in-planar alignments under acidic conditions and transmembrane orientations when the histidines are discharged. Therefore, we investigated the pH- and temperature-dependent conformations of LAH4 in DPC micellar solutions and in a TFE\/PBS solvent mixture. In the presence of detergent and at pH 4.1, LAH4 adopts helical conformations between residues 9 and 24 concomitantly with a high hydrophobic moment. At pH 6.1, a helix-loop-helix structure forms with a hinge encompassing residues His\u00b9\u2070-Ala\u00b9\u00b3. The data suggest that the high density of histidine residues and the resulting electrostatic repulsion lead to both a decrease in the pK values of the histidines and a less stable \u03b1-helical conformation of this region. The hinged structure at pH 6.1 facilitates membrane anchoring and insertion. At pH 7.8, the histidines are uncharged and an extended helical conformation including residues 4-21 is again obtained. LAH4 thus exhibits a high degree of conformational plasticity. The structures provide a stroboscopic view of the conformational changes that occur during membrane insertion, and are discussed in the context of antimicrobial activity and DNA transfection.",

        "abstract":"The LAH4 family of histidine-rich peptides exhibits potent antimicrobial and DNA transfection activities, both of which require interactions with cellular membranes. The bilayer association of the peptides has been shown to be strongly pH-dependent, with in-planar alignments under acidic conditions and transmembrane orientations when the histidines are discharged. Therefore, we investigated the pH- and temperature-dependent conformations of LAH4 in DPC micellar solutions and in a TFE\/PBS solvent mixture. In the presence of detergent and at pH 4.1, LAH4 adopts helical conformations between residues 9 and 24 concomitantly with a high hydrophobic moment. At pH 6.1, a helix-loop-helix structure forms with a hinge encompassing residues His\u00b9\u2070-Ala\u00b9\u00b3. The data suggest that the high density of histidine residues and the resulting electrostatic repulsion lead to both a decrease in the pK values of the histidines and a less stable \u03b1-helical conformation of this region. The hinged structure at pH 6.1 facilitates membrane anchoring and insertion. At pH 7.8, the histidines are uncharged and an extended helical conformation including residues 4-21 is again obtained. LAH4 thus exhibits a high degree of conformational plasticity. The structures provide a stroboscopic view of the conformational changes that occur during membrane insertion, and are discussed in the context of antimicrobial activity and DNA transfection.",

        "abstract":"Unlike random heteropolymers, natural proteins fold into unique ordered structures. Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features--for example kinked \u03b1-helices, bulged \u03b2-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups--that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models. These results illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise and provide the foundation for engineering a new generation of functional proteins free from natural evolution.",

Here, in a designed system, we examine the mutational requirements for transitioning between folds and functions. We show that switching between monomeric 3\u03b1 and\u00a04\u03b2+\u03b1 folds can occur in multiple ways with successive single amino acid changes at diverse residue positions, raising the likelihood that such transitions occur in the evolution of new folds. Even mutations on the periphery of the core can tip the balance between alternatively folded states.

Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features--for example kinked \u03b1-helices, bulged \u03b2-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups--that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models. These results illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise and provide the foundation for engineering a new generation of functional proteins free from natural evolution.",

The growing number of GPCR crystal structures demonstrates that the extracellular loops (EL) connecting the membrane-spanning helices show tremendous structural variability relative to the more structurally-conserved seven transmembrane \u03b1-helical domains. The EL of the LPA(1) receptor have not yet been conclusively resolved, and bear limited sequence identity to known structures. This study involved development of a peptide to characterize the intrinsic structure of the LPA(1) GPCR second EL. The loop was embedded between two helices that assemble into a coiled-coil, which served as a receptor-mimetic folding constraint (LPA(1)-CC-EL2 peptide). The ensemble of structures from multi-dimensional NMR experiments demonstrated that a robust coiled-coil formed without noticeable deformation due to the EL2 sequence. In contrast, the EL2 sequence showed well-defined structure only near its C-terminal residues. The NMR ensemble was combined with a computational model of the LPA(1) receptor that had previously been validated. The resulting hybrid models were evaluated using docking. Nine different hybrid models interacted with LPA 18:1 as expected, based on prior mutagenesis studies, and one was additionally consistent with antagonist affinity trends.",

        "abstract":"Paramagnetic lanthanide ions when bound to proteins offer great potential for structural investigations that utilize solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, or optical microscopy. However, many proteins do not have native metal ion binding sites and engineering a chimeric protein to bind an ion while retaining affinity for a protein of interest represents a significant challenge. Here we report the characterization of an immunoglobulin G-binding protein redesigned to include a lanthanide binding motif in place of a loop between two helices (Z-L2LBT). It was shown to bind Tb\u00b3\u207a with 130 nM affinity. Ions such as Dy\u00b3\u207a, Yb\u00b3\u207a, and Ce\u00b3\u207a produce paramagnetic effects on NMR spectra and the utility of these effects is illustrated by their use in determining a structural model of the metal-complexed Z-L2LBT protein and a preliminary characterization of the dynamic distribution of IgG Fc glycan positions. Furthermore, this designed protein is demonstrated to be a novel IgG-binding reagent for magnetic resonance imaging (Z-L2LBT:Gd\u00b3\u207a complex) and luminescence microscopy (Z-L2LBT: Tb\u00b3\u207a complex).",

        "abstract":"Unlike random heteropolymers, natural proteins fold into unique ordered structures. Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features--for example kinked \u03b1-helices, bulged \u03b2-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups--that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models. These results illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise and provide the foundation for engineering a new generation of functional proteins free from natural evolution.",

        "abstract":"Tyrosine oxidation-reduction involves proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and a reactive radical state. These properties are effectively controlled in enzymes that use tyrosine as a high-potential, one-electron redox cofactor. The \u03b13Y model protein contains Y32, which can be reversibly oxidized and reduced in voltammetry measurements. Structural and kinetic properties of \u03b13Y are presented. A solution NMR structural analysis reveals that Y32 is the most deeply buried residue in \u03b13Y. Time-resolved spectroscopy using a soluble flash-quench generated [Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)3](3+) oxidant provides high-quality Y32-O\u2022 absorption spectra. The rate constant of Y32 oxidation (kPCET) is pH dependent: 1.4 \u00d7 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) (pH 5.5), 1.8 \u00d7 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) (pH 8.5), 5.4 \u00d7 10(3) M(-1) s(-1) (pD 5.5), and 4.0 \u00d7 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) (pD 8.5). k(H)\/k(D) of Y32 oxidation is 2.5 \u00b1 0.5 and 4.5 \u00b1 0.9 at pH(D) 5.5 and 8.5, respectively. These pH and isotope characteristics suggest a concerted or stepwise, proton-first Y32 oxidation mechanism. The photochemical yield of Y32-O\u2022 is 28-58% versus the concentration of [Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)3](3+). Y32-O\u2022 decays slowly, t1\/2 in the range of 2-10 s, at both pH 5.5 and 8.5, via radical-radical dimerization as shown by second-order kinetics and fluorescence data. The high stability of Y32-O\u2022 is discussed relative to the structural properties of the Y32 site. Finally, the static \u03b13Y NMR structure cannot explain (i) how the phenolic proton released upon oxidation is removed or (ii) how two Y32-O\u2022 come together to form dityrosine. These observations suggest that the dynamic properties of the protein ensemble may play an essential role in controlling the PCET and radical decay characteristics of \u03b13Y.",

We report four de novo proteins for different targets, all experimentally verified to be well-folded, solved solution structures for two being in excellent agreement with respective design targets.",

        "abstract":"We recently described general principles for designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and nonlocal interactions. The principles relate secondary structure patterns to tertiary packing motifs and enable design of different protein topologies. To achieve fine control over protein shape and size within a particular topology, we have extended the design rules by systematically analyzing the codependencies between the lengths and packing geometry of successive secondary structure elements and the backbone torsion angles of the loop linking them. We demonstrate the control afforded by the resulting extended rule set by designing a series of proteins with the same fold but considerable variation in secondary structure length, loop geometry, \u03b2-strand registry, and overall shape. Solution NMR structures of four designed proteins for two different folds show that protein shape and size can be precisely controlled within a given protein fold. These extended design principles provide the foundation for custom design of protein structures performing desired functions.",

Here, we report the design of a membrane-spanning, four-helical bundle that transports first-row transition metal ions Zn(2+) and Co(2+), but not Ca(2+), across membranes. The conduction path was designed to contain two di-metal binding sites that bind with negative cooperativity. X-ray crystallography and solid-state and solution nuclear magnetic resonance indicate that the overall helical bundle is formed from two tightly interacting pairs of helices, which form individual domains that interact weakly along a more dynamic interface. Vesicle flux experiments show that as Zn(2+) ions diffuse down their concentration gradients, protons are antiported. These experiments illustrate the feasibility of designing membrane proteins with predefined structural and dynamic properties.",

        "abstract":"A number of classes of proteins have been engineered for high stability using consensus sequence design methods. Here we describe the engineering of a novel albumin binding domain (ABD) three-helix bundle protein. The resulting engineered ABD molecule, called ABDCon, is expressed at high levels in the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli and is highly stable, with a melting temperature of 81.5\u00b0C. ABDCon binds human, monkey and mouse serum albumins with affinity as high as 61 pM. The solution structure of ABDCon is consistent with the three-helix bundle design and epitope mapping studies enabled a precise definition of the albumin binding interface. Fusion of a 10 kDa scaffold protein to ABDCon results in a long terminal half-life of 60 h in mice and 182 h in cynomolgus monkeys. To explore the link between albumin affinity and in vivo exposure, mutations were designed at the albumin binding interface of ABDCon yielding variants that span an 11 000-fold range in affinity. The PK properties of five such variants were determined in mice in order to demonstrate the tunable nature of serum half-life, exposure and clearance with variations in albumin binding affinity.",

Our three-strand design is the first experimental model of a triple-stranded parallel \u03b2-sheet. Analysis of the designed peptides by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy supports the hypothesis that increasing the number of \u03b2-strands, from two to three, increases the stability of the parallel \u03b2-sheet. We present the first experimental evidence for cooperativity in the folding of a triple-stranded parallel \u03b2-sheet, and we show how minimal model systems may enable experimental documentation of characteristic properties, such as CD spectra, of parallel \u03b2-sheets.",

The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) has been broadly investigated. In contrast, the knowledge related to physiological roles of the melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) is lacking because of the limited number of known MC3R selective ligands. Here, we report the design, synthesis, biological activity, conformational analysis, and docking with receptors of two potent and selective agonists at the human MC3 receptor.",

        "abstract":"The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif is a protein-protein interaction module that acts as an organizing centre for complexes regulating a multitude of biological processes. Despite accumulating evidence for the formation of TPR oligomers as an additional level of regulation there is a lack of structural and solution data explaining TPR self-association. In the present work we characterize the trimeric TPR-containing protein YbgF, which is linked to the Tol system in Gram-negative bacteria. By subtracting previously identified TPR consensus residues required for stability of the fold from residues conserved across YbgF homologs, we identified residues involved in oligomerization of the C-terminal YbgF TPR domain. Crafting these residues, which are located in loop regions between TPR motifs, onto the monomeric consensus TPR protein CTPR3 induced the formation of oligomers. The crystal structure of this engineered oligomer shows an asymmetric trimer where stacking interactions between the introduced tyrosines and displacement of the C-terminal hydrophilic capping helix, present in most TPR domains, are key to oligomerization. Asymmetric trimerization of the YbgF TPR domain and CTPR3Y3 leads to the formation of higher order oligomers both in the crystal and in solution. However, such open-ended self-association does not occur in full-length YbgF suggesting that the protein's N-terminal coiled-coil domain restricts further oligomerization. This interpretation is borne out in experiments where the coiled-coil domain of YbgF was engineered onto the N-terminus of CTPR3Y3 and shown to block self-association beyond trimerization. Our study lays the foundations for understanding the structural basis for TPR domain self-association and how such self-association can be regulated in TPR domain-containing proteins.",

        "abstract":"Over the past two decades, designed metallopeptides have held the promise for understanding a variety of fundamental questions in metallobiochemistry; however, these dreams have not yet been realized because of a lack of structural data to elaborate the protein scaffolds before metal complexation and the resultant metalated structures which ultimately exist. This is because there are few reports of structural characterization of such systems either in their metalated or nonmetalated forms and no examples where an apo structure and the corresponding metalated peptide assembly have both been defined by X-ray crystallography. Herein we present X-ray structures of two de novo designed parallel three-stranded coiled coils (designed using the heptad repeat (a \u2192 g)) CSL9C (CS = Coil Ser) and CSL19C in their nonmetalated forms, determined to 1.36 and 2.15 A resolutions, respectively. Leucines from either position 9 (a site) or 19 (d site) are replaced by cysteine to generate the constructs CSL9C and CSL19C, respectively, yielding thiol-rich pockets at the hydrophobic interior of these peptides, suitable to bind heavy metals such as As(III), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). We use these structures to understand the inherent structural differences between a and d sites to clarify the basis of the observed differential spectroscopic behavior of metal binding in these types of peptides. Cys side chains of (CSL9C)(3) show alternate conformations and are partially preorganized for metal binding, whereas cysteines in (CSL19C)(3) are present as a single conformer. Zn(II) ions, which do not coordinate or influence Cys residues at the designed metal sites but are essential for forming X-ray quality crystals, are bound to His and Glu residues at the crystal packing interfaces of both structures. These \"apo\" structures are used to clarify the changes in metal site organization between metalated As(CSL9C)(3) and to speculate on the differential basis of Hg(II) binding in a versus d peptides. Thus, for the first time, one can establish general rules for heavy metal binding to Cys-rich sites in designed proteins which may provide insight for understanding how heavy metals bind to metallochaperones or metalloregulatory proteins.",

Although DARPins are already very stable molecules, molecular dynamics simulations, equilibrium denaturation experiments, structural studies, and recent NMR experiments suggested that the unfolding of the original C-terminal capping repeat (C-cap), taken from a natural ankyrin repeat protein, limits the stability of the initial DARPin design. Several point mutations had been introduced to optimize the C-cap and were shown to indeed further increase the stability of DARPins. We now determined crystal structures of DARPins with one or three full-consensus internal repeats (NI(1)C or NI(3)C) between an N-terminal capping repeat and mutants of the C-cap. An NI(1)C mutant, in which the C-cap was only extended by three additional helix-forming residues, showed no structural change but reduced B-factors in the C-cap. An NI(3)C C-cap mutant carrying five additional mutations in the interface to the preceding repeat, previously designed by using the consensus sequence as a guide, showed a rigid-body movement of the C-cap towards the internal repeat. This movement results in an increased buried surface area and a superior surface complementarity and explains the improved stability in equilibrium unfolding, compared to the original C-cap. A C-cap mutant with three additional mutations introducing suitably spaced charged residues did not show formation of salt bridges, explaining why its stability was not increased further. These structural studies underline the importance of repeat coupling for stability and help in the further design of this protein family.",

        "abstract":"Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) that specifically bind to almost any target can be obtained by ribosome display or phage display from combinatorial libraries. Although DARPins are already very stable molecules, molecular dynamics simulations, equilibrium denaturation experiments, structural studies, and recent NMR experiments suggested that the unfolding of the original C-terminal capping repeat (C-cap), taken from a natural ankyrin repeat protein, limits the stability of the initial DARPin design. Several point mutations had been introduced to optimize the C-cap and were shown to indeed further increase the stability of DARPins. We now determined crystal structures of DARPins with one or three full-consensus internal repeats (NI(1)C or NI(3)C) between an N-terminal capping repeat and mutants of the C-cap. An NI(1)C mutant, in which the C-cap was only extended by three additional helix-forming residues, showed no structural change but reduced B-factors in the C-cap. An NI(3)C C-cap mutant carrying five additional mutations in the interface to the preceding repeat, previously designed by using the consensus sequence as a guide, showed a rigid-body movement of the C-cap towards the internal repeat. This movement results in an increased buried surface area and a superior surface complementarity and explains the improved stability in equilibrium unfolding, compared to the original C-cap. A C-cap mutant with three additional mutations introducing suitably spaced charged residues did not show formation of salt bridges, explaining why its stability was not increased further. These structural studies underline the importance of repeat coupling for stability and help in the further design of this protein family.",

Here, we describe six structures of de novo proteins that have been determined using protein crystallography to address how simple enzymes perform catalysis.

Despite the addition of ATP to the crystallization conditions, the presence of a bound but distorted ATP was found only under excess ATP conditions, with ADP being present under equimolar conditions or when crystallized for a prolonged period of time. A bound ADP cofactor was evident when Asp was substituted for Val at residue 65, but ATP in a linear configuration is present when Phe was substituted for Tyr at residue 43. These new structures complement previously determined structures of DX and the protein with the Phe 43 to Tyr substitution [Simmons, C. R., et al. (2009) ACS Chem. Biol. 4, 649-658] and together demonstrate the multiple ADP\/ATP binding modes from which a model emerges in which the DX protein binds ATP in a configuration that represents a transitional state for the catalysis of ATP to ADP through a slow, metal-free reaction capable of multiple turnovers.

        "abstract":"Metal ions are an important part of many natural proteins, providing structural, catalytic and electron transfer functions. Reproducing these functions in a designed protein is the ultimate challenge to our understanding of them. Here, we present an artificial metallohydrolase, which has been shown by X-ray crystallography to contain two different metal ions-a Zn(II) ion, which is important for catalytic activity, and a Hg(II) ion, which provides structural stability. This metallohydrolase displays catalytic activity that compares well with several characteristic reactions of natural enzymes. It catalyses p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis with an efficiency only ~100-fold less than that of human carbonic anhydrase (CA)II and at least 550-fold better than comparable synthetic complexes. Similarly, CO(2) hydration occurs with an efficiency within ~500-fold of CAII. Although histidine residues in the absence of Zn(II) exhibit pNPA hydrolysis, miniscule apopeptide activity is observed for CO(2) hydration. The kinetic and structural analysis of this first de novo designed hydrolytic metalloenzyme reveals necessary design features for future metalloenzymes containing one or more metals.",

        "abstract":"The high frequency of internal structural symmetry in common protein folds is presumed to reflect their evolutionary origins from the repetition and fusion of ancient peptide modules, but little is known about the primary sequence and physical determinants of this process. Unexpectedly, a sequence and structural analysis of symmetric subdomain modules within an abundant and ancient globular fold, the \u03b2-trefoil, reveals that modular evolution is not simply a relic of the ancient past, but is an ongoing and recurring mechanism for regenerating symmetry, having occurred independently in numerous existing \u03b2-trefoil proteins. We performed a computational reconstruction of a \u03b2-trefoil subdomain module and repeated it to form a newly three-fold symmetric globular protein, ThreeFoil. In addition to its near perfect structural identity between symmetric modules, ThreeFoil is highly soluble, performs multivalent carbohydrate binding, and has remarkably high thermal stability. These findings have far-reaching implications for understanding the evolution and design of proteins via subdomain modules.",

        "abstract":"Discriminating closely related molecules remains a major challenge in the engineering of binding proteins and inhibitors. Here we report the development of highly selective inhibitors of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) family proteins. SUMOylation is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Functional differences between two major SUMO isoforms in humans, SUMO1 and SUMO2\/3, are thought to arise from distinct interactions mediated by each isoform with other proteins containing SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). However, the roles of such isoform-specific interactions are largely uncharacterized due in part to the difficulty in generating high-affinity, isoform-specific inhibitors of SUMO\/SIM interactions. We first determined the crystal structure of a \"monobody,\" a designed binding protein based on the fibronectin type III scaffold, bound to the yeast homolog of SUMO. This structure illustrated a mechanism by which monobodies bind to the highly conserved SIM-binding site while discriminating individual SUMO isoforms. Based on this structure, we designed a SUMO-targeted library from which we obtained monobodies that bound to the SIM-binding site of human SUMO1 with K(d) values of approximately 100\u00a0nM but bound to SUMO2 400 times more weakly. The monobodies inhibited SUMO1\/SIM interactions and, unexpectedly, also inhibited SUMO1 conjugation. These high-affinity and isoform-specific inhibitors will enhance mechanistic and cellular investigations of SUMO biology.",

Here we describe a computational approach whereby the surface properties and symmetry of a targeted surface define the sequence and superstructure of surface-organizing peptides. Computational design proceeds in a series of steps that encode both surface recognition and favorable intersubunit packing interactions. This procedure is exemplified in the design of peptides that assemble into a tubular structure surrounding single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). The geometrically defined, virus-like coating created by these peptides converts the smooth surfaces of SWNTs into highly textured assemblies with long-scale order, capable of directing the assembly of gold nanoparticles into helical arrays along the SWNT axis.",

        "abstract":"Here, we present the crystal structure of the synthetic peptide KE1, which contains four K-coil heptads separated in the middle by the QFLMLMF heptad. The structure determination reveals the presence of a canonical parallel three stranded coiled coil. The geometric characteristics of this structure are compared with other coiled coils with the same topology. Furthermore, for this topology, the analysis of the propensity of the single amino acid to occupy a specific position in the heptad sequence is reported. A number of viral proteins use specialized coiled coil tail needles to inject their genetic material into the host cells. The simplicity and regularity of the coiled coil arrangement made it an attractive system for de novo design of key molecules in drug delivery systems, vaccines, and therapeutics.",

We describe the computational design of a protein that binds the acidic active site of hen egg lysozyme and inhibits the enzyme. The design process starts with two polar amino acids that fit deep into the enzyme active site, identifies a protein scaffold that supports these residues and is complementary in shape to the lysozyme active-site region, and finally optimizes the surrounding contact surface for high-affinity binding. Following affinity maturation, a protein designed using this method bound lysozyme with low nanomolar affinity, and a combination of NMR studies, crystallography, and knockout mutagenesis confirmed the designed binding surface and orientation. Saturation mutagenesis with selection and deep sequencing demonstrated that specific designed interactions extending well beyond the centrally grafted polar residues are critical for high-affinity binding.",

        "abstract":"To probe the potential for activity in unevolved amino acid sequence space, we created a third generation combinatorial library of de novo four-helix bundle proteins. The \"artificial superfamily\" of helical bundles was designed using binary patterning of polar and nonpolar residues, and expressed in Escherichia coli from a library of synthetic genes. WA20, picked from the library, is one of the most stable proteins in the superfamily, and has rudimentary activities such as esterase and lipase. Here we report the crystal structure of WA20, determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method. Unexpectedly, the WA20 crystal structure is not a monomeric four-helix bundle, but a dimeric four-helix bundle. Each monomer comprises two long \u03b1-helices that intertwist with the helices of the other monomer. The two monomers together form a 3D domain-swapped four-helix bundle dimer. In addition, there are two hydrophobic pockets, which may potentially provide substrate binding sites. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that the molecular weight of WA20 is ~25 kDa and the shape is rod-like (the maximum length, D(max) = ~8 nm), indicating that WA20 forms a dimeric four-helix bundle in solution. These results demonstrate that our de novo protein library contains not only simple monomeric proteins, but also stable and functional multimeric proteins.",

Directed evolution of a computationally designed enzyme suggests that pronounced molecular changes can also drive the optimization of primitive protein active sites. The specific activity of an artificial retro-aldolase was boosted >4,400-fold by random mutagenesis and screening, affording catalytic efficiencies approaching those of natural enzymes. However, structural and mechanistic studies reveal that the engineered catalytic apparatus, consisting of a reactive lysine and an ordered water molecule, was unexpectedly abandoned in favor of a new lysine residue in a substrate-binding pocket created during the optimization process. Structures of the initial in silico design, a mechanistically promiscuous intermediate and one of the most evolved variants highlight the importance of loop mobility and supporting functional groups in the emergence of the new catalytic center. Such internal competition between alternative reactive sites may have characterized the early evolution of many natural enzymes.",

        "abstract":"Armadillo repeat proteins (ArmRPs) recognize their target peptide in extended conformation and bind, in a first approximation, two residues per repeat. Thus, they may form the basis for building a modular system, in which each repeat is complementary to a piece of the target peptide. Accordingly, preselected repeats could be assembled into specific binding proteins on demand and thereby avoid the traditional generation of every new binding molecule by an independent selection from a library. Stacked armadillo repeats, each consisting of 42 aa arranged in three \u03b1-helices, build an elongated superhelical structure. Here, we analyzed the curvature variations in natural ArmRPs and identified a repeat pair from yeast importin-\u03b1 as having the optimal curvature geometry that is complementary to a peptide over its whole length. We employed a symmetric in silico design to obtain a uniform sequence for a stackable repeat while maintaining the desired curvature geometry. Computationally designed ArmRPs (dArmRPs) had to be stabilized by mutations to remove regions of higher flexibility, which were identified by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Using an N-capping repeat from the consensus-design approach, two different crystal structures of dArmRP were determined. Although the experimental structures of dArmRP deviated from the designed curvature, the insertion of the most conserved binding pockets of natural ArmRPs onto the surface of dArmRPs resulted in binders against the expected peptide with low nanomolar affinities, similar to the binders from the consensus-design series.",

Before the emergence of biosynthetic pathways, this set is the most plausible resource for protein formation (i.e., proteogenesis) within the overall process of abiogenesis. An essential unsolved question regarding this prebiotic set is whether it defines a \"foldable set\"--that is, does it contain sufficient chemical information to permit cooperatively folding polypeptides? If so, what (if any) characteristic properties might such polypeptides exhibit? To investigate these questions, two \"primitive\" versions of an extant protein fold (the \u03b2-trefoil) were produced by top-down symmetric deconstruction, resulting in a reduced alphabet size of 12 or 13 amino acids and a percentage of prebiotic amino acids approaching 80%. These proteins show a substantial acidification of pI and require high salt concentrations for cooperative folding. The results suggest that the prebiotic amino acids do comprise a foldable set within the halophile environment.",

        "abstract":"The armadillo domain is a right-handed super-helix of repeating units composed of three \u03b1-helices each. Armadillo repeat proteins (ArmRPs) are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions, and because of their modular recognition of extended peptide regions they can serve as templates for the design of artificial peptide binding scaffolds. On the basis of sequential and structural analyses, different consensus-designed ArmRPs were synthesized and show high thermodynamic stabilities, compared to naturally occurring ArmRPs. We determined the crystal structures of four full-consensus ArmRPs with three or four identical internal repeats and two different designs for the N- and C-caps. The crystal structures were refined at resolutions ranging from 1.80 to 2.50 \u00c5 for the above mentioned designs. A redesign of our initial caps was required to obtain well diffracting crystals. However, the structures with the redesigned caps caused domain swapping events between the N-caps. To prevent this domain swap, 9 and 6 point mutations were introduced in the N- and C-caps, respectively. Structural and biophysical analysis showed that this subsequent redesign of the N-cap prevented domain swapping and improved the thermodynamic stability of the proteins. We systematically investigated the best cap combinations. We conclude that designed ArmRPs with optimized caps are intrinsically stable and well-expressed monomeric proteins and that the high-resolution structures provide excellent structural templates for the continuation of the design of sequence-specific modular peptide recognition units based on armadillo repeats.",

Here, we focus on a single critical property of many enzymes: the nucleophilicity of an active site residue that initiates catalysis. We design proteins with idealized serine-containing catalytic triads and assess their nucleophilicity directly in native biological systems using activity-based organophosphate probes. Crystal structures of the most successful designs show unprecedented agreement with computational models, including extensive hydrogen bonding networks between the catalytic triad (or quartet) residues, and mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that these networks are critical for serine activation and organophosphate reactivity. Following optimization by yeast display, the designs react with organophosphate probes at rates comparable to natural serine hydrolases. Co-crystal structures with diisopropyl fluorophosphate bound to the serine nucleophile suggest that the designs could provide the basis for a new class of organophosphate capture agents.",

        "abstract":"Protein engineering, chemical biology, and synthetic biology would benefit from toolkits of peptide and protein components that could be exchanged reliably between systems while maintaining their structural and functional integrity. Ideally, such components should be highly defined and predictable in all respects of sequence, structure, stability, interactions, and function. To establish one such toolkit, here we present a basis set of de novo designed \u03b1-helical coiled-coil peptides that adopt defined and well-characterized parallel dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric states. The designs are based on sequence-to-structure relationships both from the literature and analysis of a database of known coiled-coil X-ray crystal structures. These give foreground sequences to specify the targeted oligomer state. A key feature of the design process is that sequence positions outside of these sites are considered non-essential for structural specificity; as such, they are referred to as the background, are kept non-descript, and are available for mutation as required later. Synthetic peptides were characterized in solution by circular-dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation, and their structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. Intriguingly, a hitherto widely used empirical rule-of-thumb for coiled-coil dimer specification does not hold in the designed system. However, the desired oligomeric state is achieved by database-informed redesign of that particular foreground and confirmed experimentally. We envisage that the basis set will be of use in directing and controlling protein assembly, with potential applications in chemical and synthetic biology. To help with such endeavors, we introduce Pcomp, an on-line registry of peptide components for protein-design and synthetic-biology applications.",

Previously we have used cyclically constrained \u03b2 residues to promote \u03b1\/\u03b2-peptide helicity; here we show that an engineered ion pair array can be comparably effective, as indicated by mimicry of the CHR domain of HIV protein gp41. The new design is effective in biochemical and cell-based infectivity assays; however, the resulting \u03b1\/\u03b2-peptide is susceptible to proteolysis. This susceptibility was addressed via introduction of a few cyclic \u03b2 residues near the cleavage site, to produce the most stable, effective \u03b1\/\u03b2-peptide gp41 CHR analogue identified. Crystal structures of an \u03b1- and \u03b1\/\u03b2-peptide (each involved in a gp41-mimetic helix bundle) that contain the dense acid\/base residue array manifest disorder in the ionic side chains, but there is little side-chain disorder in analogous \u03b1- and \u03b1\/\u03b2-peptide structures with a sparser ionic side-chain array. These observations suggest that dense arrays of complementary acidic and basic residues can provide conformational stabilization via Coulombic attractions that do not require entropically costly ordering of side chains.",

Previously we have used cyclically constrained \u03b2 residues to promote \u03b1\/\u03b2-peptide helicity; here we show that an engineered ion pair array can be comparably effective, as indicated by mimicry of the CHR domain of HIV protein gp41. The new design is effective in biochemical and cell-based infectivity assays; however, the resulting \u03b1\/\u03b2-peptide is susceptible to proteolysis. This susceptibility was addressed via introduction of a few cyclic \u03b2 residues near the cleavage site, to produce the most stable, effective \u03b1\/\u03b2-peptide gp41 CHR analogue identified. Crystal structures of an \u03b1- and \u03b1\/\u03b2-peptide (each involved in a gp41-mimetic helix bundle) that contain the dense acid\/base residue array manifest disorder in the ionic side chains, but there is little side-chain disorder in analogous \u03b1- and \u03b1\/\u03b2-peptide structures with a sparser ionic side-chain array. These observations suggest that dense arrays of complementary acidic and basic residues can provide conformational stabilization via Coulombic attractions that do not require entropically costly ordering of side chains.",

        "abstract":"Self-assembling cyclic protein homo-oligomers play important roles in biology, and the ability to generate custom homo-oligomeric structures could enable new approaches to probe biological function. Here we report a general approach to design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to assess the designability of a protein-protein interface. This method is sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models. X-ray crystal structures were obtained for five of the designs and each is very close to their corresponding computational model.",

Here we report a general approach to design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to assess the designability of a protein-protein interface. This method is sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models.

Building on 13 crystal structures of DARPin-target complexes and stability measurements of DARPin mutants, we have generated a new DARPin library containing an extended randomized surface. To counteract the enrichment of unspecific hydrophobic binders during selections against difficult targets containing hydrophobic surfaces such as membrane proteins, the frequency of apolar residues at diversified positions was drastically reduced and substituted by an increased number of tyrosines. Ribosome display selections against two human caspases and membrane transporter AcrB yielded highly enriched pools of unique and strong DARPin binders which were mainly monomeric. We noted a prominent enrichment of tryptophan residues during binder selections. A crystal structure of a representative of this library in complex with caspase-7 visualizes the key roles of both tryptophans and tyrosines in providing target contacts. These aromatic and polar side chains thus substitute the apolar residues valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and phenylalanine of the original DARPins.

The structures of the five variants showing aggregation reveal 3D domain swapped dimers. In all five cases, the swapping involves the C-terminal \u03b2-strand resulting in the formation of Tencon dimers in which the target-binding surface is blocked. All of the variants differ in sequence in the FG loop, which is the hinge loop in the \u03b2-strand-swapped dimers. The six tencon variants have between 0 and 5 residues inserted between positions 77 and 78 in the FG loop. Analysis of the structures suggests that a non-glycine residue at position 77 and insertions of <4 residues may destabilize the \u03b2-turn in the FG loop promoting \u03b2-strand swapping. Swapped dimers with an odd number of inserted residues may be less stable, particularly if they contain proline residues, because they cannot form perfect \u03b2-bridges in the FG regions that link the swapped dimers. The Tencon \u03b2-swapped variants with the longest FG sequences are observed to form higher order hexameric or helical oligomeric structures in the crystal correlating well with the aggregation properties of these domains observed in solution.

A comparison with the unswapped structure reveals that the side chain of residue F88 orients differently and packs more tightly with the hydrophobic core of the domain. Dimer formation also results in the burial of a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the domain. Thus, it appears that tighter packing of F88 in the hydrophobic core and burial of surface hydrophobicity provide the driving forces for the N-terminal \u03b2-strand swapping, leading to the formation of a stable compact dimer.",

We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of the Adhiron scaffold to 1.75 \u00c5 resolution revealing a compact cystatin-like fold. We have constructed a phage-display library in this scaffold by insertion of two variable peptide regions. The library is of high quality and complexity comprising 1.3 \u00d7 10(10) clones. To demonstrate library efficacy, we screened against the yeast Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO). In selected clones, variable region 1 often contained sequences homologous to the known SUMO interactive motif (V\/I-X-V\/I-V\/I). Four Adhirons were further characterised and displayed low nanomolar affinities and high specificity for yeast SUMO with essentially no cross-reactivity to human SUMO protein isoforms. We have identified binders against >100 target molecules to date including as examples, a fibroblast growth factor (FGF1), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1; CD31), the SH2 domain Grb2 and a 12-aa peptide. Adhirons are highly stable and well expressed allowing highly specific binding reagents to be selected for use in molecular recognition applications.",

        "abstract":"A highly diverse DNA library coding for ankyrin seven-repeat proteins (ANK-N5C) was designed and constructed by a PCR-based combinatorial assembly strategy. A bacterial melibiose fermentation assay was adapted for in vivo functional screen. We isolated a transcription blocker that completely inhibits the melibiose-dependent expression of \u03b1-galactosidase (MelA) and melibiose permease (MelB) of Escherichia coli by specifically preventing activation of the melAB operon. High-resolution crystal structural determination reveals that the designed ANK-N5C protein has a typical ankyrin fold, and the specific transcription blocker, ANK-N5C-281, forms a domain-swapped dimer. Functional tests suggest that the activity of MelR, a DNA-binding transcription activator and a member of AraC family of transcription factors, is inhibited by ANK-N5C-281 protein. All ANK-N5C proteins are expected to have a concave binding area with negative surface potential, suggesting that the designed ANK-N5C library proteins may facilitate the discovery of binders recognizing structural motifs with positive surface potential, like in DNA-binding proteins. Overall, our results show that the established library is a useful tool for the discovery of novel bioactive reagents.",

Success of such evolutionary processes suggests that the duplicated structural motif must be capable of nucleating protein folding. If correct, symmetric expansion of a folding nucleus sequence derived from an extant symmetric fold may be an elegant and computationally tractable solution to de novo protein design. We report the efficient de novo design of a \u03b2-trefoil protein by symmetric expansion of a \u03b2-trefoil folding nucleus, previously identified by \u0278-value analysis. The resulting protein, having exact sequence symmetry, exhibits superior folding properties compared to its naturally evolved progenitor-with the potential for redundant folding nuclei. In principle, folding nucleus symmetric expansion can be applied to any given symmetric protein fold (that is, nearly one-third of the known proteome) provided information of the folding nucleus is available.",

        "abstract":"Amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type II diabetes share common features of toxic soluble protein oligomers. There are no structures at atomic resolution of oligomers formed by full-length amyloidogenic peptides and proteins, and only a few structures of oligomers formed by peptide fragments. The paucity of structural information provides a fundamental roadblock to understanding the pathology of amyloid diseases and developing preventions or therapies. Here, we present the X-ray crystallographic structures of three families of oligomers formed by macrocyclic peptides containing a heptapeptide sequence derived from the amyloidogenic E chain of \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m). Each macrocyclic peptide contains the heptapeptide sequence \u03b22m63-69 and a second heptapeptide sequence containing an N-methyl amino acid. These peptides form \u03b2-sheets that further associate into hexamers, octamers, and dodecamers: the hexamers are trimers of dimers; the octamers are tetramers of dimers; and the dodecamers contain two trimer subunits surrounded by three pairs of \u03b2-sheets. These structures illustrate a common theme in which dimer and trimer subunits further associate to form a hydrophobic core. The seven X-ray crystallographic structures not only illustrate a range of oligomers that a single amyloidogenic peptide sequence can form, but also how mutation can alter the size and topology of the oligomers. A cocrystallization experiment in which a dodecamer-forming peptide recruits a hexamer-forming peptide to form mixed dodecamers demonstrates that one species can dictate the oligomerization of another. These findings should also be relevant to the formation of oligomers of full-length peptides and proteins in amyloid diseases.",

There are no structures at atomic resolution of oligomers formed by full-length amyloidogenic peptides and proteins, and only a few structures of oligomers formed by peptide fragments. The paucity of structural information provides a fundamental roadblock to understanding the pathology of amyloid diseases and developing preventions or therapies. Here, we present the X-ray crystallographic structures of three families of oligomers formed by macrocyclic peptides containing a heptapeptide sequence derived from the amyloidogenic E chain of \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m). Each macrocyclic peptide contains the heptapeptide sequence \u03b22m63-69 and a second heptapeptide sequence containing an N-methyl amino acid. These peptides form \u03b2-sheets that further associate into hexamers, octamers, and dodecamers: the hexamers are trimers of dimers; the octamers are tetramers of dimers; and the dodecamers contain two trimer subunits surrounded by three pairs of \u03b2-sheets. These structures illustrate a common theme in which dimer and trimer subunits further associate to form a hydrophobic core. The seven X-ray crystallographic structures not only illustrate a range of oligomers that a single amyloidogenic peptide sequence can form, but also how mutation can alter the size and topology of the oligomers. A cocrystallization experiment in which a dodecamer-forming peptide recruits a hexamer-forming peptide to form mixed dodecamers demonstrates that one species can dictate the oligomerization of another. These findings should also be relevant to the formation of oligomers of full-length peptides and proteins in amyloid diseases.",

        "abstract":"A highly diverse DNA library coding for ankyrin seven-repeat proteins (ANK-N5C) was designed and constructed by a PCR-based combinatorial assembly strategy. A bacterial melibiose fermentation assay was adapted for in vivo functional screen. We isolated a transcription blocker that completely inhibits the melibiose-dependent expression of \u03b1-galactosidase (MelA) and melibiose permease (MelB) of Escherichia coli by specifically preventing activation of the melAB operon. High-resolution crystal structural determination reveals that the designed ANK-N5C protein has a typical ankyrin fold, and the specific transcription blocker, ANK-N5C-281, forms a domain-swapped dimer. Functional tests suggest that the activity of MelR, a DNA-binding transcription activator and a member of AraC family of transcription factors, is inhibited by ANK-N5C-281 protein. All ANK-N5C proteins are expected to have a concave binding area with negative surface potential, suggesting that the designed ANK-N5C library proteins may facilitate the discovery of binders recognizing structural motifs with positive surface potential, like in DNA-binding proteins. Overall, our results show that the established library is a useful tool for the discovery of novel bioactive reagents.",

Here we describe a general approach to control the shape of the binding surface on repeat-protein scaffolds and apply it to leucine-rich-repeat proteins. First, self-compatible building-block modules are designed that, when polymerized, generate surfaces with unique but constant curvatures. Second, a set of junction modules that connect the different building blocks are designed. Finally, new proteins with custom-designed shapes are generated by appropriately combining building-block and junction modules. Crystal structures of the designs illustrate the power of the approach in controlling repeat-protein curvature.",

Combinatorial design calculations identify low-energy sequences for alternative helix supercoil arrangements, and the helices in the lowest-energy arrangements are connected by loop building. We design an antiparallel monomeric untwisted three-helix bundle with 80-residue helices, an antiparallel monomeric right-handed four-helix bundle, and a pentameric parallel left-handed five-helix bundle. The designed proteins are extremely stable (extrapolated \u0394Gfold > 60 kilocalories per mole), and their crystal structures are close to those of the design models with nearly identical core packing between the helices. The approach enables the custom design of hyperstable proteins with fine-tuned geometries for a wide range of applications.",

        "abstract":"Consensus protein design is a rapid and reliable technique for the improvement of protein stability, which relies on the use of homologous protein sequences. To enhance the stability of a fibronectin type III (FN3) domain, consensus design was employed using an alignment of 2123 sequences. The resulting FN3 domain, FN3con, has unprecedented stability, with a melting temperature >100\u00b0C, a \u0394G(D-N) of 15.5 kcal mol(-1) and a greatly reduced unfolding rate compared with wild-type. To determine the underlying molecular basis for stability, an X-ray crystal structure of FN3con was determined to 2.0 \u00c5 and compared with other FN3 domains of varying stabilities. The structure of FN3con reveals significantly increased salt bridge interactions that are cooperatively networked, and a highly optimized hydrophobic core. Molecular dynamics simulations of FN3con and comparison structures show the cooperative power of electrostatic and hydrophobic networks in improving FN3con stability. Taken together, our data reveal that FN3con stability does not result from a single mechanism, but rather the combination of several features and the removal of non-conserved, unfavorable interactions. The large number of sequences employed in this study has most likely enhanced the robustness of the consensus design, which is now possible due to the increased sequence availability in the post-genomic era. These studies increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern stability and demonstrate the rising potential for enhancing stability via the consensus method.",

In order to develop such a system, three crystal structures of designed armadillo-repeat proteins with third-generation N-caps (YIII-type), four or five internal repeats (M-type) and second-generation C-caps (AII-type) were determined at 1.8 \u00c5 (His-YIIIM4AII), 2.0 \u00c5 (His-YIIIM5AII) and 1.95 \u00c5 (YIIIM5AII) resolution and compared with those of variants with third-generation C-caps. All constructs are full consensus designs in which the internal repeats have exactly the same sequence, and hence identical conformations of the internal repeats are expected. The N-cap and internal repeats M1 to M3 are indeed extremely similar, but the comparison reveals structural differences in internal repeats M4 and M5 and the C-cap. These differences are caused by long-range effects of the C-cap, contacting molecules in the crystal, and the intrinsic design of the repeat. Unfortunately, the rigid-body movement of the C-terminal part impairs the regular arrangement of internal repeats that forms the putative peptide-binding site. The second-generation C-cap improves the packing of buried residues and thereby the stability of the protein. These considerations are useful for future improvements of an armadillo-repeat-based peptide-recognition system.",

The N-cap and internal repeats M1 to M3 are indeed extremely similar, but the comparison reveals structural differences in internal repeats M4 and M5 and the C-cap. These differences are caused by long-range effects of the C-cap, contacting molecules in the crystal, and the intrinsic design of the repeat. Unfortunately, the rigid-body movement of the C-terminal part impairs the regular arrangement of internal repeats that forms the putative peptide-binding site. The second-generation C-cap improves the packing of buried residues and thereby the stability of the protein. These considerations are useful for future improvements of an armadillo-repeat-based peptide-recognition system.",

        "abstract":"The ability to design and construct structures with atomic level precision is one of the key goals of nanotechnology. Proteins offer an attractive target for atomic design because they can be synthesized chemically or biologically and can self-assemble. However, the generalized protein folding and design problem is unsolved. One approach to simplifying the problem is to use a repetitive protein as a scaffold. Repeat proteins are intrinsically modular, and their folding and structures are better understood than large globular domains. Here, we have developed a class of synthetic repeat proteins based on the pentapeptide repeat family of beta-solenoid proteins. We have constructed length variants of the basic scaffold and computationally designed de novo loops projecting from the scaffold core. The experimentally solved 3.56-\u00c5 resolution crystal structure of one designed loop matches closely the designed hairpin structure, showing the computational design of a backbone extension onto a synthetic protein core without the use of backbone fragments from known structures. Two other loop designs were not clearly resolved in the crystal structures, and one loop appeared to be in an incorrect conformation. We have also shown that the repeat unit can accommodate whole-domain insertions by inserting a domain into one of the designed loops.",

We have applied these methods to design a series of closed \u03b1-solenoid repeat structures (\u03b1-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering, our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an example, we have successfully designed and validated closed \u03b1-solenoid repeats with a left-handed helical architecture that--to our knowledge--is not yet present in the protein structure database.",

        "abstract":"Despite impressive successes in protein design, designing a well-folded protein of more 100 amino acids de novo remains a formidable challenge. Exploiting the promising biophysical features of the artificial protein Octarellin V, we improved this protein by directed evolution, thus creating a more stable and soluble protein: Octarellin V.1. Next, we obtained crystals of Octarellin V.1 in complex with crystallization chaperons and determined the tertiary structure. The experimental structure of Octarellin V.1 differs from its in silico design: the (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1) sandwich architecture bears some resemblance to a Rossman-like fold instead of the intended TIM-barrel fold. This surprising result gave us a unique and attractive opportunity to test the state of the art in protein structure prediction, using this artificial protein free of any natural selection. We tested 13 automated webservers for protein structure prediction and found none of them to predict the actual structure. More than 50% of them predicted a TIM-barrel fold, i.e. the structure we set out to design more than 10years ago. In addition, local software runs that are human operated can sample a structure similar to the experimental one but fail in selecting it, suggesting that the scoring and ranking functions should be improved. We propose that artificial proteins could be used as tools to test the accuracy of protein structure prediction algorithms, because their lack of evolutionary pressure and unique sequences features.",

Although several studies have identified inhibitor candidates using rationale design, more detailed understanding of the interaction and binding interface is necessary to inform development of superior inhibitors. In this work, we report a detailed biophysical analysis of the native interaction with both peptide and Adhiron phage display experiments to identify novel binding motifs and binding regions of the surface of p300 to inform future inhibitor design.",

        "abstract":"Natural armadillo repeat proteins (nArmRP) like importin-\u03b1 or \u03b2-catenin bind their target peptides such that each repeat interacts with a dipeptide unit within the stretched target peptide. However, this modularity is imperfect and also restricted to short peptide stretches of usually four to six consecutive amino acids. Here we report the development and characterization of a regularized and truly modular peptide-specific binding protein, based on designed armadillo repeat proteins (dArmRP), binding to peptides of alternating lysine and arginine residues (KR)n. dArmRP were obtained from nArmRP through cycles of extensive protein engineering, which rendered them more uniform. This regularity is reflected in the consistent binding of dArmRP to (KR)-peptides, where affinities depend on the lengths of target peptides and the number of internal repeats in a very systematic manner, thus confirming the modularity of the interaction. This exponential dependency between affinity and recognition length suggests that each module adds a constant increment of binding energy to sequence-specific recognition. This relationship was confirmed by comprehensive mutagenesis studies that also reveal the importance of individual peptide side chains. The 1.83 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of a dArmRP with five identical internal repeats in complex with the cognate (KR)5 peptide proves a modular binding mode, where each dipeptide is recognized by one internal repeat. The confirmation of this true modularity over longer peptide stretches lays the ground for the design of binders with different specificities and tailored affinities by the assembly of dipeptide-specific modules based on armadillo repeats.",

The exercise consisted of three phases. The first phase required the participants to identify and rank order which designed sequences were able to bind the small molecule digoxigenin. The second phase challenged the community to select a near-native pose of digoxigenin from a set of decoy poses for two of the designed proteins. The third phase investigated the ability of current methods to rank\/score the binding affinity of 10 related steroids to one of the designed proteins (pKd = 4.1 to 6.7). We found that 11 of 13 groups were able to correctly select the sequence that bound digoxigenin, with most groups providing the correct three-dimensional structure for the backbone of the protein as well as all atoms of the active-site residues. Eleven of the 14 groups were able to select the appropriate pose from a set of plausible decoy poses. The ability to predict absolute binding affinities is still a difficult task, as 8 of 14 groups were able to correlate scores to affinity (Pearson-r > 0.7) of the designed protein for congeneric steroids and only 5 of 14 groups were able to correlate the ranks of the 10 related ligands (Spearman-\u03c1 > 0.7).",

Here we describe the computational design of four-fold symmetrical (\u03b2\/\u03b1)8 barrels guided by geometrical and chemical principles. Experimental characterization of 33 designs revealed the importance of side chain-backbone hydrogen bonds for defining the strand register between repeat units. The X-ray crystal structure of a designed thermostable 184-residue protein is nearly identical to that of the designed TIM-barrel model. PSI-BLAST searches do not identify sequence similarities to known TIM-barrel proteins, and sensitive profile-profile searches indicate that the design sequence is distant from other naturally occurring TIM-barrel superfamilies, suggesting that Nature has sampled only a subset of the sequence space available to the TIM-barrel fold.

        "abstract":"Tandem repeat proteins, which are formed by repetition of modular units of protein sequence and structure, play important biological roles as macromolecular binding and scaffolding domains, enzymes, and building blocks for the assembly of fibrous materials. The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and recombination of simple building blocks. The overall architecture of tandem repeat protein structures--which is dictated by the internal geometry and local packing of the repeat building blocks--is highly diverse, ranging from extended, super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners, to closed and compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding and catalysis. Here we report the development and validation of computational methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied these methods to design a series of closed \u03b1-solenoid repeat structures (\u03b1-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering, our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an example, we have successfully designed and validated closed \u03b1-solenoid repeats with a left-handed helical architecture that--to our knowledge--is not yet present in the protein structure database.",

        "abstract":"A compelling target for the design of electron transfer proteins with novel cofactors is to create a model for the oxygen-evolving complex, a Mn4Ca cluster, of photosystem II. A mononuclear Mn cofactor can be added to the bacterial reaction center, but the addition of multiple metal centers is constrained by the native protein architecture. Alternatively, metal centers can be incorporated into artificial proteins. Designs for the addition of dinuclear metal centers to four-helix bundles resulted in three artificial proteins with ligands for one, two, or three dinuclear metal centers able to bind Mn. The three-dimensional structure determined by X-ray crystallography of one of the Mn-proteins confirmed the design features and revealed details concerning coordination of the Mn center. Electron transfer between these artificial Mn-proteins and bacterial reaction centers was investigated using optical spectroscopy. After formation of a light-induced, charge-separated state, the experiments showed that the Mn-proteins can donate an electron to the oxidized bacteriochlorophyll dimer of modified reaction centers, with the Mn-proteins having additional metal centers being more effective at this electron transfer reaction. Modeling of the structure of the Mn-protein docked to the reaction center showed that the artificial protein likely binds on the periplasmic surface similarly to cytochrome c2, the natural secondary donor. Combining reaction centers with exogenous artificial proteins provides the opportunity to create ligands and investigate the influence of inhomogeneous protein environments on multinuclear redox-active metal centers.

Koder and J.L. Ross Anderson.",

This new Pizza variant carries two nearly identical domains per polypeptide chain, and forms a trimer with three-fold symmetry. The designed single metal ion binding site lies on the symmetry axis, bonding the trimer together. Two copies of the trimer associate in the presence of cadmium chloride in solution, and very high-resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals a nanocrystal of cadmium chloride, sandwiched between two trimers of the protein. This nanocrystal, containing seven cadmium ions lying in a plane and twelve interspersed chloride ions, is the smallest reported to date.

A similar challenge presumably limited the emergence of large and complex protein topologies in evolution. Here, we demonstrate that protein topologies with six and seven-stranded beta sheets can be designed by insertion of one de novo designed beta sheet containing protein into another such that the two beta sheets are merged to form a single extended sheet, followed by amino acid sequence optimization at the newly formed strand-strand, strand-helix, and helix-helix interfaces. Crystal structures of two such designs closely match the computational design models. Searches for similar structures in the SCOP protein domain database yield only weak matches with different beta sheet connectivities. A similar beta sheet fusion mechanism may have contributed to the emergence of complex beta sheets during natural protein evolution.",

Of these, 53 are monomeric and stable at 95\u2009\u00b0C, and 43 have solution X-ray scattering spectra consistent with the design models. Crystal structures of 15 designs spanning a broad range of curvatures are in close agreement with the design models with root mean square deviations ranging from 0.7 to 2.5\u2009\u00c5. Our results show that existing repeat proteins occupy only a small fraction of the possible repeat protein sequence and structure space and that it is possible to design novel repeat proteins with precisely specified geometries, opening up a wide array of new possibilities for biomolecular engineering.",

Repeat proteins composed of multiple tandem copies of a modular structure unit are widespread in nature and have critical roles in molecular recognition, signalling, and other essential biological processes. Naturally occurring repeat proteins have been re-engineered for molecular recognition and modular scaffolding applications. Here we use computational protein design to investigate the space of folded structures that can be generated by tandem repeating a simple helix-loop-helix-loop structural motif. Eighty-three designs with sequences unrelated to known repeat proteins were experimentally characterized. Of these, 53 are monomeric and stable at 95\u2009\u00b0C, and 43 have solution X-ray scattering spectra consistent with the design models. Crystal structures of 15 designs spanning a broad range of curvatures are in close agreement with the design models with root mean square deviations ranging from 0.7 to 2.5\u2009\u00c5. Our results show that existing repeat proteins occupy only a small fraction of the possible repeat protein sequence and structure space and that it is possible to design novel repeat proteins with precisely specified geometries, opening up a wide array of new possibilities for biomolecular engineering.",

Templates from the protein databank (PDB) are often used as initial models that can be modified to introduce new properties. We examine whether it is possible to reconnect a protein in a manner that generates a new topology yet preserves its structural integrity. Here, we describe the rethreading of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from E. coli (wtDHFR). The rethreading process involved the removal of three native loops, and the introduction of three new loops with alternate connections. The structure of the rethreaded DHFR (rDHFR-1) was determined to 1.6\u2009\u00c5, demonstrating the success of the rethreading process. Both wtDHFR and rDHFR-1 exhibited similar affinities towards methotrexate. However, rDHFR-1 showed no reducing activity towards dihydrofolate, and exhibited about ~6-fold lower affinity towards NADPH than wtDHFR. This work demonstrates that protein rethreading can be a powerful tool for the design of a large array of proteins with novel structures and topologies, and that by careful rearrangement of a protein sequence, the sequence to structure relationship can be expanded substantially.",

Here, we have developed a class of synthetic repeat proteins based on the pentapeptide repeat family of beta-solenoid proteins. We have constructed length variants of the basic scaffold and computationally designed de novo loops projecting from the scaffold core. The experimentally solved 3.56-\u00c5 resolution crystal structure of one designed loop matches closely the designed hairpin structure, showing the computational design of a backbone extension onto a synthetic protein core without the use of backbone fragments from known structures. Two other loop designs were not clearly resolved in the crystal structures, and one loop appeared to be in an incorrect conformation. We have also shown that the repeat unit can accommodate whole-domain insertions by inserting a domain into one of the designed loops.",

We describe a computational protocol, called SEWING, which is inspired by this process and builds new proteins from connected or disconnected pieces of existing structures. Helical proteins designed with SEWING contain structural features absent from other de novo designed proteins and, in some cases, remain folded at more than 100\u00b0C. High-resolution structures of the designed proteins CA01 and DA05R1 were solved by x-ray crystallography (2.2 angstrom resolution) and nuclear magnetic resonance, respectively, and there was excellent agreement with the design models. This method provides a new strategy to rapidly create large numbers of diverse and designable protein scaffolds.",

Here we demonstrate how the isoenergetic energy landscape of higher-order coiled coils can enable the formation of an oligomerization switch by insertion of a single destabilizing element into an otherwise stable computationally designed scaffold. We describe a de novo designed peptide that was discovered to switch between a parallel symmetric pentamer at pH 8 and a trimer of antiparallel dimers at pH 6. The transition between pentamer and hexamer is caused by changes in the protonation states of glutamatic acid residues with highly upshifted pKa values in both oligomer forms. The drastic conformational change coupled with the narrow pH range makes the peptide sequence an attractive candidate for introduction of pH sensing into other proteins. The results highlight the remarkable ability of simple-\u03b1 helices to self-assemble into a vast range of structural states.",

The 1.70 \u00c5 X-ray crystallographic structure of peptide 1a shows six \u03b1-helices associating in an antiparallel arrangement around a central axis comprising hydrophobic and aromatic residues. Size-exclusion chromatography studies suggest that peptides 1 form stable oligomers in solution, and circular dichroism experiments show that peptides 1 are stable to relatively high temperatures. Small-angle X-ray scattering studies of the solution behavior of peptide 1a indicate an equilibrium of dimers, hexamers, and larger aggregates in solution. The structures presented here represent a new motif of biomolecular self-assembly not previously observed for de novo peptides and suggest supramolecular design principles for material scaffolds based on coiled-coil motifs containing aromatic residues.",

        "abstract":"Learning to engineer self-assembly would enable the precise organization of molecules by design to create matter with tailored properties. Here we demonstrate that proteins can direct the self-assembly of buckminsterfullerene (C60) into ordered superstructures. A previously engineered tetrameric helical bundle binds C60 in solution, rendering it water soluble. Two tetramers associate with one C60, promoting further organization revealed in a 1.67-\u00c5 crystal structure. Fullerene groups occupy periodic lattice sites, sandwiched between two Tyr residues from adjacent tetramers. Strikingly, the assembly exhibits high charge conductance, whereas both the protein-alone crystal and amorphous C60 are electrically insulating. The affinity of C60 for its crystal-binding site is estimated to be in the nanomolar range, with lattices of known protein crystals geometrically compatible with incorporating the motif. Taken together, these findings suggest a new means of organizing fullerene molecules into a rich variety of lattices to generate new properties by design.",

        "abstract":"Learning to engineer self-assembly would enable the precise organization of molecules by design to create matter with tailored properties. Here we demonstrate that proteins can direct the self-assembly of buckminsterfullerene (C60) into ordered superstructures. A previously engineered tetrameric helical bundle binds C60 in solution, rendering it water soluble. Two tetramers associate with one C60, promoting further organization revealed in a 1.67-\u00c5 crystal structure. Fullerene groups occupy periodic lattice sites, sandwiched between two Tyr residues from adjacent tetramers. Strikingly, the assembly exhibits high charge conductance, whereas both the protein-alone crystal and amorphous C60 are electrically insulating. The affinity of C60 for its crystal-binding site is estimated to be in the nanomolar range, with lattices of known protein crystals geometrically compatible with incorporating the motif. Taken together, these findings suggest a new means of organizing fullerene molecules into a rich variety of lattices to generate new properties by design.",

        "abstract":"Learning to engineer self-assembly would enable the precise organization of molecules by design to create matter with tailored properties. Here we demonstrate that proteins can direct the self-assembly of buckminsterfullerene (C60) into ordered superstructures. A previously engineered tetrameric helical bundle binds C60 in solution, rendering it water soluble. Two tetramers associate with one C60, promoting further organization revealed in a 1.67-\u00c5 crystal structure. Fullerene groups occupy periodic lattice sites, sandwiched between two Tyr residues from adjacent tetramers. Strikingly, the assembly exhibits high charge conductance, whereas both the protein-alone crystal and amorphous C60 are electrically insulating. The affinity of C60 for its crystal-binding site is estimated to be in the nanomolar range, with lattices of known protein crystals geometrically compatible with incorporating the motif. Taken together, these findings suggest a new means of organizing fullerene molecules into a rich variety of lattices to generate new properties by design.",

        "abstract":"Self-assembling cyclic protein homo-oligomers play important roles in biology, and the ability to generate custom homo-oligomeric structures could enable new approaches to probe biological function. Here we report a general approach to design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to assess the designability of a protein-protein interface. This method is sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models. X-ray crystal structures were obtained for five of the designs and each is very close to their corresponding computational model.",

        "abstract":"Attempts to create novel ligand-binding proteins often focus on formation of a binding pocket with shape complementarity against the desired ligand (particularly for compounds that lack distinct polar moieties). Although designed proteins often exhibit binding of the desired ligand, in some cases they display unintended recognition behavior. One such designed protein, that was originally intended to bind tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was found instead to display binding of 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol (25-D3) and was subjected to biochemical characterization, further selections for enhanced 25-D3 binding affinity and crystallographic analyses. The deviation in specificity is due in part to unexpected altertion of its conformation, corresponding to a significant change of the orientation of an \u03b1-helix and an equally large movement of a loop, both of which flank the designed ligand-binding pocket. Those changes led to engineered protein constructs that exhibit significantly more contacts and complementarity towards the 25-D3 ligand than the initial designed protein had been predicted to form towards its intended THC ligand. Molecular dynamics simulations imply that the initial computationally designed mutations may contribute to the movement of the helix. These analyses collectively indicate that accurate prediction and control of backbone dynamics conformation, through a combination of improved conformational sampling and\/or de novo structure design, represents a key area of further development for the design and optimization of engineered ligand-binding proteins.",

        "abstract":"In nature, structural specificity in DNA and proteins is encoded differently: In DNA, specificity arises from modular hydrogen bonds in the core of the double helix, whereas in proteins, specificity arises largely from buried hydrophobic packing complemented by irregular peripheral polar interactions. Here, we describe a general approach for designing a wide range of protein homo-oligomers with specificity determined by modular arrays of central hydrogen-bond networks. We use the approach to design dimers, trimers, and tetramers consisting of two concentric rings of helices, including previously not seen triangular, square, and supercoiled topologies. X-ray crystallography confirms that the structures overall, and the hydrogen-bond networks in particular, are nearly identical to the design models, and the networks confer interaction specificity in vivo. The ability to design extensive hydrogen-bond networks with atomic accuracy enables the programming of protein interaction specificity for a broad range of synthetic biology applications; more generally, our results demonstrate that, even with the tremendous diversity observed in nature, there are fundamentally new modes of interaction to be discovered in proteins.",

        "abstract":"In nature, structural specificity in DNA and proteins is encoded differently: In DNA, specificity arises from modular hydrogen bonds in the core of the double helix, whereas in proteins, specificity arises largely from buried hydrophobic packing complemented by irregular peripheral polar interactions. Here, we describe a general approach for designing a wide range of protein homo-oligomers with specificity determined by modular arrays of central hydrogen-bond networks. We use the approach to design dimers, trimers, and tetramers consisting of two concentric rings of helices, including previously not seen triangular, square, and supercoiled topologies. X-ray crystallography confirms that the structures overall, and the hydrogen-bond networks in particular, are nearly identical to the design models, and the networks confer interaction specificity in vivo. The ability to design extensive hydrogen-bond networks with atomic accuracy enables the programming of protein interaction specificity for a broad range of synthetic biology applications; more generally, our results demonstrate that, even with the tremendous diversity observed in nature, there are fundamentally new modes of interaction to be discovered in proteins.",

        "abstract":"Despite the development of powerful computational tools, the full-sequence design of proteins still remains a challenging task. To investigate the limits and capabilities of computational tools, we conducted a study of the ability of the program Rosetta to predict sequences that recreate the authentic fold of thioredoxin. Focusing on the influence of conformational details in the template structures, we based our study on 8 experimentally determined template structures and generated 120 designs from each. For experimental evaluation, we chose six sequences from each of the eight templates by objective criteria. The 48 selected sequences were evaluated based on their progressive ability to (1) produce soluble protein in Escherichia coli and (2) yield stable monomeric protein, and (3) on the ability of the stable, soluble proteins to adopt the target fold. Of the 48 designs, we were able to synthesize 32, 20 of which resulted in soluble protein. Of these, only two were sufficiently stable to be purified. An X-ray crystal structure was solved for one of the designs, revealing a close resemblance to the target structure. We found a significant difference among the eight template structures to realize the above three criteria despite their high structural similarity. Thus, in order to improve the success rate of computational full-sequence design methods, we recommend that multiple template structures are used. Furthermore, this study shows that special care should be taken when optimizing the geometry of a structure prior to computational design when using a method that is based on rigid conformations.",

Such peptides can have excellent pharmaceutical properties, combining the stability and tissue penetration of small-molecule drugs with the specificity of much larger protein therapeutics. The ability to design constrained peptides with precisely specified tertiary structures would enable the design of shape-complementary inhibitors of arbitrary targets. Here we describe the development of computational methods for accurate de novo design of conformationally restricted peptides, and the use of these methods to design 18-47 residue, disulfide-crosslinked peptides, a subset of which are heterochiral and\/or N-C backbone-cyclized. Both genetically encodable and non-canonical peptides are exceptionally stable to thermal and chemical denaturation, and 12 experimentally determined X-ray and NMR structures are nearly identical to the computational design models. The computational design methods and stable scaffolds presented here provide the basis for development of a new generation of peptide-based drugs.",

        "abstract":"In nature, structural specificity in DNA and proteins is encoded differently: In DNA, specificity arises from modular hydrogen bonds in the core of the double helix, whereas in proteins, specificity arises largely from buried hydrophobic packing complemented by irregular peripheral polar interactions. Here, we describe a general approach for designing a wide range of protein homo-oligomers with specificity determined by modular arrays of central hydrogen-bond networks. We use the approach to design dimers, trimers, and tetramers consisting of two concentric rings of helices, including previously not seen triangular, square, and supercoiled topologies. X-ray crystallography confirms that the structures overall, and the hydrogen-bond networks in particular, are nearly identical to the design models, and the networks confer interaction specificity in vivo. The ability to design extensive hydrogen-bond networks with atomic accuracy enables the programming of protein interaction specificity for a broad range of synthetic biology applications; more generally, our results demonstrate that, even with the tremendous diversity observed in nature, there are fundamentally new modes of interaction to be discovered in proteins.",

Here we report a general approach to design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to assess the designability of a protein-protein interface. This method is sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models. X-ray crystal structures were obtained for five of the designs and each is very close to their corresponding computational model.",

Here we report a general approach to design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to assess the designability of a protein-protein interface. This method is sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models. X-ray crystal structures were obtained for five of the designs and each is very close to their corresponding computational model.",

        "abstract":"Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPin \u00ae ) are artificial non-immunoglobulin binding proteins with potential applications as therapeutic molecules. DARPin 6G9 binds interleukin-13 with high affinity and blocks the signaling pathway and as such is promising for the treatment of asthma and other atopic diseases. The crystal structures of DARPin 6G9 in the unbound form and in complex with IL-13 were determined at high resolution. The DARPin competes for the same epitope as the IL-13 receptor chain 13R\u03b11 but does not interfere with the binding of the other receptor chain, IL-4R\u03b1. Analysis of multiple copies of the DARPin molecule in the crystal indicates the conformational instability in the N-terminal cap that was predicted from molecular dynamics simulations. Comparison of the DARPin structures in the free state and in complex with IL-13 reveals a concerted movement of the ankyrin repeats upon binding resulted in the opening of the binding site. The induced-fit mode of binding employed by DARPin 6G9 is very unusual for DARPins since they were designed as particularly stable and rigid molecules. This finding shows that DARPins can operate by various binding mechanisms and suggests that some flexibility in the scaffold may be an advantage.",

Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling \u03b2-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of \u03b2 sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved \u03b2 sheets topped with \u03b1 helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that \u03b2-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.",

        "abstract":"Active sites and ligand-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by curved \u03b2 sheets, and the ability to control \u03b2-sheet curvature would allow design of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling \u03b2-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of \u03b2 sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved \u03b2 sheets topped with \u03b1 helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that \u03b2-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.",

        "abstract":"Naturally occurring, pharmacologically active peptides constrained with covalent crosslinks generally have shapes that have evolved to fit precisely into binding pockets on their targets. Such peptides can have excellent pharmaceutical properties, combining the stability and tissue penetration of small-molecule drugs with the specificity of much larger protein therapeutics. The ability to design constrained peptides with precisely specified tertiary structures would enable the design of shape-complementary inhibitors of arbitrary targets. Here we describe the development of computational methods for accurate de novo design of conformationally restricted peptides, and the use of these methods to design 18-47 residue, disulfide-crosslinked peptides, a subset of which are heterochiral and\/or N-C backbone-cyclized. Both genetically encodable and non-canonical peptides are exceptionally stable to thermal and chemical denaturation, and 12 experimentally determined X-ray and NMR structures are nearly identical to the computational design models. The computational design methods and stable scaffolds presented here provide the basis for development of a new generation of peptide-based drugs.",

Antibodies or other scaffold proteins can provide the cellular address for delivering a covalently linked therapeutic via specific binding to cell-surface receptors. Optimization of the conjugation site on the targeting protein, linker chemistry and intracellular trafficking pathways can all influence the efficiency of delivery and potency of the drug candidate. In this study, we describe a comprehensive engineering experiment for an EGFR binding Centyrin, a highly stable fibronectin type III (FN3) domain, wherein all possible single-cysteine replacements were evaluated for expression, purification, conjugation efficiency, retention of target binding, biophysical properties and delivery of a cytotoxic small molecule payload. Overall, 26 of the 94 positions were identified as ideal for cysteine modification, conjugation and drug delivery. Conjugation-tolerant positions were mapped onto a crystal structure of the Centyrin, providing a structural context for interpretation of the mutagenesis experiment and providing a foundation for a Centyrin-targeted delivery platform.",

Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling \u03b2-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of \u03b2 sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved \u03b2 sheets topped with \u03b1 helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that \u03b2-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.",

In this study, we demonstrate a method to build up rigid multivalent and multispecific scaffolds by exploiting the modular nature of a repeat protein scaffold and avoiding flexible linkers. We use DARPins (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins), synthetic binding proteins based on the Ankyrin-repeat protein scaffold, as binding units. Their ease of in vitro selection, high production yield and stability make them ideal specificity-conferring building blocks for the design of more complex constructs. C- and N-terminal DARPin capping repeats were re-designed to be joined by a shared helix in such a way that rigid connector modules are formed. This allows us to join two or more DARPins in predefined geometries without compromising their binding affinities and specificities. Nine connector modules with distinct geometries were designed; for eight of these we were able to confirm the structure by X-ray crystallography, while only one did not crystallize. The bispecific constructs were all able to bind both target proteins simultaneously.",

This allows us to join two or more DARPins in predefined geometries without compromising their binding affinities and specificities. Nine connector modules with distinct geometries were designed; for eight of these we were able to confirm the structure by X-ray crystallography, while only one did not crystallize.

        "abstract":"Designed armadillo repeat proteins (dArmRPs) were developed to create a modular peptide binding technology where each of the structural repeats binds two residues of the target peptide. An essential prerequisite for such a technology is a dArmRP geometry that matches the peptide bond length. To this end, we determined a large set (n=27) of dArmRP X-ray structures, of which 12 were previously unpublished, to calculate curvature parameters that define their geometry. Our analysis shows that consensus dArmRPs exhibit curvatures close to the optimal range for modular peptide recognition. Binding of peptide ligands can induce a curvature within the desired range, as confirmed by single-molecule FRET experiments in solution. On the other hand, computationally designed ArmRPs, where side chains have been chosen with the intention to optimally fit into a geometrically optimized backbone, turned out to be more divergent in reality, and thus not suitable for continuous peptide binding. Furthermore, we show that the formation of a crystal lattice can induce small but significant deviations from the curvature adopted in solution, which can interfere with the evaluation of repeat protein scaffolds when high accuracy is required. This study corroborates the suitability of consensus dArmRPs as a scaffold for the development of modular peptide binders.",

        "abstract":"Designed armadillo repeat proteins (dArmRP) are \u03b1-helical solenoid repeat proteins with an extended peptide binding groove that were engineered to develop a generic modular technology for peptide recognition. In this context, the term \"peptide\" not only denotes a short unstructured chain of amino acids, but also an unstructured region of a protein, as they occur in termini, loops, or linkers between folded domains. Here we report two crystal structures of dArmRPs, in complex with peptides fused either to the N-terminus of Green Fluorescent Protein or to the C-terminus of a phage lambda protein D. These structures demonstrate that dArmRPs bind unfolded peptides in the intended conformation also when they constitute unstructured parts of folded proteins, which greatly expands possible applications of the dArmRP technology. Nonetheless, the structures do not fully reflect the binding behavior in solution, that is, some binding sites remain unoccupied in the crystal and even unexpected peptide residues appear to be bound. We show how these differences can be explained by restrictions of the crystal lattice or the composition of the crystallization solution. This illustrates that crystal structures have to be interpreted with caution when protein-peptide interactions are characterized, and should always be correlated with measurements in solution.",

An essential prerequisite for such a technology is a dArmRP geometry that matches the peptide bond length. To this end, we determined a large set (n=27) of dArmRP X-ray structures, of which 12 were previously unpublished, to calculate curvature parameters that define their geometry. Our analysis shows that consensus dArmRPs exhibit curvatures close to the optimal range for modular peptide recognition. Binding of peptide ligands can induce a curvature within the desired range, as confirmed by single-molecule FRET experiments in solution. On the other hand, computationally designed ArmRPs, where side chains have been chosen with the intention to optimally fit into a geometrically optimized backbone, turned out to be more divergent in reality, and thus not suitable for continuous peptide binding. Furthermore, we show that the formation of a crystal lattice can induce small but significant deviations from the curvature adopted in solution, which can interfere with the evaluation of repeat protein scaffolds when high accuracy is required. This study corroborates the suitability of consensus dArmRPs as a scaffold for the development of modular peptide binders.",

        "abstract":"DNA is typically found as a double helix, however it must be separated into single strands during all phases of DNA metabolism; including transcription, replication, recombination and repair. Although recent breakthroughs have enabled the design of modular RNA- and double-stranded DNA-binding proteins, there are currently no tools available to manipulate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Here we show that artificial pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins can be programmed for sequence-specific ssDNA binding. Interactions occur using the same code and specificity as for RNA binding. We solve the structures of DNA-bound and apo proteins revealing the basis for ssDNA binding and how hydrogen bond rearrangements enable the PPR structure to envelope its ssDNA target. Finally, we show that engineered PPRs can be designed to bind telomeric ssDNA and can block telomerase activity. The modular mode of ssDNA binding by PPR proteins provides tools to target ssDNA and to understand its importance in cells.",

Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling \u03b2-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of \u03b2 sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved \u03b2 sheets topped with \u03b1 helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that \u03b2-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.",

        "abstract":"Disulfide-rich peptides represent an important protein family with broad pharmacological potential. Recent advances in computational methods have made it possible to design new peptides which adopt a stable conformation de novo. Here, we describe a system to produce disulfide-rich de novo peptides using Escherichia coli as the expression host. The advantage of this system is that it enables production of uniformly  13  C- and  15  N-labeled peptides for solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. This expression system was used to isotopically label two previously reported de novo designed peptides, and to determine their solution structures using NMR. The ensemble of NMR structures calculated for both peptides agreed well with the design models, further confirming the accuracy of the design protocol. Collection of NMR data on the peptides under reducing conditions revealed a dependency on disulfide bonds to maintain stability. Furthermore, we performed long-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with tempering to assess the stability of two families of de novo designed peptides. Initial designs which exhibited a stable structure during simulations were more likely to adopt a stable structure in vitro, but attempts to utilize this method to redesign unstable peptides to fold into a stable state were unsuccessful. Further work is therefore needed to assess the utility of MD simulation techniques for de novo protein design.",

        "abstract":"Active sites and ligand-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by curved \u03b2 sheets, and the ability to control \u03b2-sheet curvature would allow design of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling \u03b2-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of \u03b2 sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved \u03b2 sheets topped with \u03b1 helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that \u03b2-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.",

        "abstract":"Although metal ion binding to naturally occurring l-amino acid proteins is well documented, understanding the impact of the opposite chirality (d-)amino acids on the structure and stereochemistry of metals is in its infancy. We examine the effect of a d-configuration cysteine within a designed l-amino acid three-stranded coiled coil in order to enforce a precise coordination number on a metal center. The d chirality does not alter the native fold, but the side-chain re-orientation modifies the sterics of the metal binding pocket. l-Cys side chains within the coiled-coil structure have previously been shown to rotate substantially from their preferred positions in the apo structure to create a binding site for a tetra-coordinate metal ion. However, here we show by X-ray crystallography that d-Cys side chains are preorganized within a suitable geometry to bind such a ligand. This is confirmed by comparison of the structure of Zn II  Cl(CSL16 D  C) 3  2-  to the published structure of Zn II  (H 2  O)(GRAND-CSL12AL16 L  C) 3  -  . Moreover, spectroscopic analysis indicates that the Cd II  geometry observed by using l-Cys ligands (a mixture of three- and four-coordinate Cd II  ) is altered to a single four-coordinate species when d-Cys is present. This work opens a new avenue for the control of the metal site environment in man-made proteins, by simply altering the binding ligand with its mirror-imaged d configuration. Thus, the use of non-coded amino acids in the coordination sphere of a metal promises to be a powerful tool for controlling the properties of future metalloproteins.",

        "abstract":"The interaction of a positively charged amino acid residue with a negatively charged residue (i.e. a salt bridge) can contribute substantially to protein conformational stability, especially when two ionic groups are in close proximity. At longer distances, this stabilizing effect tends to drop off precipitously. However, several lines of evidence suggest that salt-bridge interaction could persist at longer distances if an aromatic amino acid residue were positioned between the anion and cation. Here we explore this possibility in the context of a peptide in which a Lys residue occupies the i + 8 position relative to an i-position Glu on the solvent-exposed surface of a helix-bundle homotrimer. Variable temperature circular dichroism (CD) experiments indicate that an i + 4-position Trp enables a favorable long-range interaction between Glu and the i + 8 Lys. A substantial portion of this effect relies on the presence of a hydrogen-bond donor on the arene; however, non-polar arenes, a cyclic hydrocarbon, and an acyclic Leu side-chain can also enhance the long-range salt bridge, possibly by excluding water and ions from the space between Glu and Lys.",

This unique feature has enabled applications ranging from use as biochemical tools to therapeutic agents. Nanobodies have emerged as especially useful tools in protein structural biology, facilitating studies of conformationally dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Nearly all nanobodies available to date have been obtained by animal immunization, a bottleneck restricting many applications of this technology. To solve this problem, we report a fully in vitro platform for nanobody discovery based on yeast surface display. We provide a blueprint for identifying nanobodies, demonstrate the utility of the library by crystallizing a nanobody with its antigen, and most importantly, we utilize the platform to discover conformationally selective nanobodies to two distinct human GPCRs. To facilitate broad deployment of this platform, the library and associated protocols are freely available for nonprofit research.",

More recently, the discovery of the cross-\u03b2 amyloid state revealed that deeper energy minima exist, often associated with pathogenic, fibrillar deposits, when the concentration of proteins reaches a critical value. Fortunately, a sizable energy barrier impedes the conversion from native to pathogenic states. However, little is known about the structure of the related transition state. In addition, there are indications of polymorphism in the amyloidogenic process. Here, we report the first evidence of the conversion of metastable cross-\u03b1-helical crystals to thermodynamically stable cross-\u03b2-sheet-like fibrils by a de novo designed heptapeptide. Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrate at atomic resolution that the flip of a peptide plane from a type I to a type II' turn facilitates transformation to cross-\u03b2 structure and assembly of a dry steric zipper. This study establishes the potential of a peptide turn, a common protein secondary structure, to serve as a principal gatekeeper between a native metastable folded state and the amyloid state.",

        "abstract":"Coiled coils are a robust motif for exploring amino acid interactions, generating unique supramolecular structures, and expanding the functional properties of biological materials. A recently discovered antiparallel coiled-coil hexamer (ACC-Hex, peptide 1) exhibits a unique interaction in which Phe and Ile residues from adjacent \u03b1-helices interact to form a Phe-Ile zipper within the hydrophobic core. Analysis of the X-ray crystallographic structure of ACC-Hex suggests that the stability of the six-helix bundle relies on specific interactions between the Phe and Ile residues. The Phe-Ile zipper is unprecedented and represents a powerful tool for utilizing the Phe-Ile interactions to direct supramolecular assembly. To further probe and understand the limits of the Phe-Ile zipper, we designed peptide sequences with natural and unnatural amino acids placed at the Phe and Ile residue positions. Using size exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering, we found that the proper assembly of ACC-Hex from monomers is sensitive to subtle changes in side chain steric bulk and hydrophobicity introduced by mutations at the Phe and Ile residue positions. Of the sequence variants that formed ACC-Hex, mutations in the hydrophobic core significantly affected the stability of the hexamer, from a \u0394G u  w  of 2-8 kcal mol -1 . Additional sequences were designed to further probe and enhance the stability of the ACC-Hex system by maximizing salt bridging between the solvent-exposed residues. Finally, we expanded on the generality of the Phe-Ile zipper, creating a unique sequence that forms an antiparallel hexamer that is topologically similar to ACC-Hex but atomistically unique.",

        "abstract":"Coiled coils are a robust motif for exploring amino acid interactions, generating unique supramolecular structures, and expanding the functional properties of biological materials. A recently discovered antiparallel coiled-coil hexamer (ACC-Hex, peptide 1) exhibits a unique interaction in which Phe and Ile residues from adjacent \u03b1-helices interact to form a Phe-Ile zipper within the hydrophobic core. Analysis of the X-ray crystallographic structure of ACC-Hex suggests that the stability of the six-helix bundle relies on specific interactions between the Phe and Ile residues. The Phe-Ile zipper is unprecedented and represents a powerful tool for utilizing the Phe-Ile interactions to direct supramolecular assembly. To further probe and understand the limits of the Phe-Ile zipper, we designed peptide sequences with natural and unnatural amino acids placed at the Phe and Ile residue positions. Using size exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering, we found that the proper assembly of ACC-Hex from monomers is sensitive to subtle changes in side chain steric bulk and hydrophobicity introduced by mutations at the Phe and Ile residue positions. Of the sequence variants that formed ACC-Hex, mutations in the hydrophobic core significantly affected the stability of the hexamer, from a \u0394G u  w  of 2-8 kcal mol -1 . Additional sequences were designed to further probe and enhance the stability of the ACC-Hex system by maximizing salt bridging between the solvent-exposed residues. Finally, we expanded on the generality of the Phe-Ile zipper, creating a unique sequence that forms an antiparallel hexamer that is topologically similar to ACC-Hex but atomistically unique.",

Recent advances in computational methods have made it possible to design new peptides which adopt a stable conformation de novo. Here, we describe a system to produce disulfide-rich de novo peptides using Escherichia coli as the expression host. The advantage of this system is that it enables production of uniformly  13  C- and  15  N-labeled peptides for solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. This expression system was used to isotopically label two previously reported de novo designed peptides, and to determine their solution structures using NMR. The ensemble of NMR structures calculated for both peptides agreed well with the design models, further confirming the accuracy of the design protocol. Collection of NMR data on the peptides under reducing conditions revealed a dependency on disulfide bonds to maintain stability. Furthermore, we performed long-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with tempering to assess the stability of two families of de novo designed peptides. Initial designs which exhibited a stable structure during simulations were more likely to adopt a stable structure in vitro, but attempts to utilize this method to redesign unstable peptides to fold into a stable state were unsuccessful. Further work is therefore needed to assess the utility of MD simulation techniques for de novo protein design.",

        "abstract":"De novo design provides an attractive approach to test the mechanism by which metalloproteins define the geometry and reactivity of their metal ion cofactors. While there has been considerable progress in designing proteins that bind transition metal ions including iron-sulfur clusters, the design of tetranuclear clusters with oxygen-rich environments has not been accomplished. Here, we describe the design of tetranuclear clusters, consisting of four Zn 2+  and four carboxylate oxygens situated at the vertices of a distorted cube-like structure. The tetra-Zn 2+  clusters are bound at a buried site within a four-helix bundle, with each helix donating a single carboxylate (Glu or Asp) and imidazole (His) ligand, as well as second- and third-shell ligands. Overall, the designed site consists of four Zn 2+  and 16 polar side chains in a fully connected hydrogen-bonded network. The designed proteins have apolar cores at the top and bottom of the bundle, which drive the assembly of the liganding residues near the center of the bundle. The steric bulk of the apolar residues surrounding the binding site was varied to determine how subtle changes in helix-helix packing affect the binding site. The crystal structures of two of four proteins synthesized were in good agreement with the overall design; both formed a distorted cuboidal site stabilized by flanking second- and third-shell interactions that stabilize the primary ligands. A third structure bound a single Zn 2+  in an unanticipated geometry, and the fourth bound multiple Zn 2+  at multiple sites at partial occupancy. The metal-binding and conformational properties of the helical bundles in solution, probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and NMR, were consistent with the crystal structures.",

        "abstract":"To acquire extremely thermostable proteins of given functions is challenging for conventional protein engineering. Here we applied ABACUS, a statistical energy function we developed for de novo amino acid sequence design, to globally redesign a Ras-binding domain (RBD), and obtained an extremely thermostable RBD that unfolds reversibly at above 110\u00b0C, the redesigned RBD experimentally confirmed to have expected structure and Ras-binding interface. Directed evolution of the redesigned RBD improved its Ras-binding affinity to the native protein level without excessive loss of thermostability. The designed amino acid substitutions were mostly at the protein surface. For many substitutions, strong epistasis or significantly differentiated effects on thermostability in the native sequence context relative to the redesigned sequence context were observed, suggesting the globally redesigned sequence to be unreachable through combining beneficial mutations of the native sequence. Further analyses revealed that by replacing 38 of a total of 48 non-interfacial surface residues at once, ABACUS redesign was able to globally \"invert\" the protein's charge distribution pattern in an optimized way. Our study demonstrates that computational protein design provides powerful new tools to solve challenging protein engineering problems.",

Thus, stabilizing the helical conformation of peptides can lead to increases in binding potency, specificity, and stability towards proteolytic degradation. Helices have been successfully stabilized by introducing side chain-to-side chain crosslinks within the central portion of the helix. However, this approach leaves the ends of the helix free, thus leading to fraying and exposure of the non-hydrogen-bonded amide groups to solvent. Here, we develop a \"capped-strapped\" peptide strategy to stabilize helices by embedding the entire length of the helix within a macrocycle, which also includes a semirigid organic template as well as end-capping interactions. We have designed a ten-residue capped-strapped helical peptide that behaves like a miniprotein, with a cooperative thermal unfolding transition and T m  \u224870\u2009\u00b0C, unprecedented for helical peptides of this length.

We applied a phylogenetic analysis that yielded a sequence logo of the putative ancestral Walker-A P-loop element: a \u03b2-strand connected to an \u03b1-helix via the P-loop. Computational design incorporated this element into de novo designed \u03b2-\u03b1 repeat proteins with relatively few sequence modifications. We obtained soluble, stable proteins that unlike modern P-loop NTPases bound ATP in a magnesium-independent manner. Foremost, these simple P-loop proteins avidly bound polynucleotides, RNA, and single-strand DNA, and mutations in the P-loop's key residues abolished binding. Binding appears to be facilitated by the structural plasticity of these proteins, including quaternary structure polymorphism that promotes a combined action of multiple P-loops. Accordingly, oligomerization enabled a 55-aa protein carrying a single P-loop to confer avid polynucleotide binding. Overall, our results show that the P-loop Walker-A motif can be implemented in small and simple \u03b2-\u03b1 repeat proteins, primarily as a polynucleotide binding motif.",

        "abstract":"Amyloids adopt 'cross-\u03b2' structures composed of long, twisted fibrils with \u03b2-strands running perpendicular to the fibril axis. Recently, a toxic peptide was proposed to form amyloid-like cross-\u03b1 structures in solution, with a planar bilayer-like assembly observed in the crystal structure. Here we crystallographically characterize designed peptides that assemble into spiraling cross-\u03b1 amyloid-like structures, which resemble twisted \u03b2-amyloid fibrils. The peptides form helical dimers, stabilized by packing of small and apolar residues, and the dimers further assemble into cross-\u03b1 amyloid-like fibrils with superhelical pitches ranging from 170\u2009\u00c5 to 200\u2009\u00c5. When a small residue that appeared critical for packing was converted to leucine, it resulted in structural rearrangement to a helical polymer. Fluorescently tagged versions of the designed peptides form puncta in mammalian cells, which recover from photobleaching with markedly different kinetics. These structural folds could be potentially useful for directing in vivo protein assemblies with predetermined spacing and stabilities.",

        "abstract":"Amyloids adopt 'cross-\u03b2' structures composed of long, twisted fibrils with \u03b2-strands running perpendicular to the fibril axis. Recently, a toxic peptide was proposed to form amyloid-like cross-\u03b1 structures in solution, with a planar bilayer-like assembly observed in the crystal structure. Here we crystallographically characterize designed peptides that assemble into spiraling cross-\u03b1 amyloid-like structures, which resemble twisted \u03b2-amyloid fibrils. The peptides form helical dimers, stabilized by packing of small and apolar residues, and the dimers further assemble into cross-\u03b1 amyloid-like fibrils with superhelical pitches ranging from 170\u2009\u00c5 to 200\u2009\u00c5. When a small residue that appeared critical for packing was converted to leucine, it resulted in structural rearrangement to a helical polymer. Fluorescently tagged versions of the designed peptides form puncta in mammalian cells, which recover from photobleaching with markedly different kinetics. These structural folds could be potentially useful for directing in vivo protein assemblies with predetermined spacing and stabilities.",

        "abstract":"Current single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques can produce images of large protein assemblies and macromolecular complexes at atomic level detail without the need for crystal growth. However, proteins of smaller size, typical of those found throughout the cell, are not presently amenable to detailed structural elucidation by cryo-EM. Here we use protein design to create a modular, symmetrical scaffolding system to make protein molecules of typical size suitable for cryo-EM. Using a rigid continuous alpha helical linker, we connect a small 17-kDa protein (DARPin) to a protein subunit that was designed to self-assemble into a cage with cubic symmetry. We show that the resulting construct is amenable to structural analysis by single-particle cryo-EM, allowing us to identify and solve the structure of the attached small protein at near-atomic detail, ranging from 3.5- to 5-\u00c5 resolution. The result demonstrates that proteins considerably smaller than the theoretical limit of 50 kDa for cryo-EM can be visualized clearly when arrayed in a rigid fashion on a symmetric designed protein scaffold. Furthermore, because the amino acid sequence of a DARPin can be chosen to confer tight binding to various other protein or nucleic acid molecules, the system provides a future route for imaging diverse macromolecules, potentially broadening the application of cryo-EM to proteins of typical size in the cell.",

Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with \u03b2-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of \u03b2-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of \u03b2-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI,\u00a0and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures.",

Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with \u03b2-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of \u03b2-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of \u03b2-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI,\u00a0and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures.",

        "abstract":"Amyloids adopt 'cross-\u03b2' structures composed of long, twisted fibrils with \u03b2-strands running perpendicular to the fibril axis. Recently, a toxic peptide was proposed to form amyloid-like cross-\u03b1 structures in solution, with a planar bilayer-like assembly observed in the crystal structure. Here we crystallographically characterize designed peptides that assemble into spiraling cross-\u03b1 amyloid-like structures, which resemble twisted \u03b2-amyloid fibrils. The peptides form helical dimers, stabilized by packing of small and apolar residues, and the dimers further assemble into cross-\u03b1 amyloid-like fibrils with superhelical pitches ranging from 170\u2009\u00c5 to 200\u2009\u00c5. When a small residue that appeared critical for packing was converted to leucine, it resulted in structural rearrangement to a helical polymer. Fluorescently tagged versions of the designed peptides form puncta in mammalian cells, which recover from photobleaching with markedly different kinetics. These structural folds could be potentially useful for directing in vivo protein assemblies with predetermined spacing and stabilities.",

        "abstract":"The regular arrangements of \u03b2-strands around a central axis in \u03b2-barrels and of \u03b1-helices in coiled coils contrast with the irregular tertiary structures of most globular proteins, and have fascinated structural biologists since they were first discovered. Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with \u03b2-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of \u03b2-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of \u03b2-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI,\u00a0and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures.",

        "abstract":"The Trp-cage, an 18-20 residue miniprotein, has emerged as a primary test system for evaluating computational fold prediction and folding rate determination efforts. As it turns out, a number of stabilizing interactions in the Trp-cage folded state have a strong pH dependence; all prior Trp-cage mutants have been destabilized under carboxylate-protonating conditions. Notable among the pH dependent stabilizing interactions within the Trp-cage are: (1) an Asp as the helix N-cap, (2) an H-bonded Asp9\/Arg16 salt bridge, (3) an interaction between the chain termini which are in close spatial proximity, and (4) additional side chain interactions with Asp9. In the present study, we have prepared Trp-cage species that are significantly more stable at pH 2.5 (rather than 7) and quantitated the contribution of each interaction listed above. The Trp-cage structure remains constant with the pH change. The study has also provided measures of the stabilizing contribution of indole ring shielding from surface exposure and the destabilizing effects of an ionized Asp at the C-terminus of an \u03b1-helix.",

        "abstract":"Specificity of interactions between two DNA strands, or between protein and DNA, is often achieved by varying bases or side chains coming off the DNA or protein backbone-for example, the bases participating in Watson-Crick pairing in the double helix, or the side chains contacting DNA in TALEN-DNA complexes. By contrast, specificity of protein-protein interactions usually involves backbone shape complementarity 1 , which is less modular and hence harder to generalize. Coiled-coil heterodimers are an exception, but the restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions 2 ) limits the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by varying side-chain interactions 3,4 . Here we show that protein-protein interaction\u00a0specificity can be achieved using extensive and modular side-chain hydrogen-bond networks. We used the Crick generating equations 5  to produce millions of four-helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling around a central axis, identified those accommodating extensive hydrogen-bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect pairs of helices with short loops and to optimize the remainder of the sequence. Of 97 such designs expressed in Escherichia coli, 65 formed constitutive heterodimers, and the crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement with the computational models and confirmed the designed hydrogen-bond networks. In cells, six heterodimers were fully orthogonal, and in vitro-following mixing of 32 chains from 16 heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5\u00a0M guanidine hydrochloride and reannealing-almost all of the interactions observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed cognate pairs. The ability to design orthogonal protein heterodimers should enable sophisticated protein-based control logic for synthetic biology, and illustrates that nature has not fully explored the possibilities for programmable biomolecular interaction modalities.",

        "abstract":"Specificity of interactions between two DNA strands, or between protein and DNA, is often achieved by varying bases or side chains coming off the DNA or protein backbone-for example, the bases participating in Watson-Crick pairing in the double helix, or the side chains contacting DNA in TALEN-DNA complexes. By contrast, specificity of protein-protein interactions usually involves backbone shape complementarity 1 , which is less modular and hence harder to generalize. Coiled-coil heterodimers are an exception, but the restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions 2 ) limits the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by varying side-chain interactions 3,4 . Here we show that protein-protein interaction\u00a0specificity can be achieved using extensive and modular side-chain hydrogen-bond networks. We used the Crick generating equations 5  to produce millions of four-helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling around a central axis, identified those accommodating extensive hydrogen-bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect pairs of helices with short loops and to optimize the remainder of the sequence. Of 97 such designs expressed in Escherichia coli, 65 formed constitutive heterodimers, and the crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement with the computational models and confirmed the designed hydrogen-bond networks. In cells, six heterodimers were fully orthogonal, and in vitro-following mixing of 32 chains from 16 heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5\u00a0M guanidine hydrochloride and reannealing-almost all of the interactions observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed cognate pairs. The ability to design orthogonal protein heterodimers should enable sophisticated protein-based control logic for synthetic biology, and illustrates that nature has not fully explored the possibilities for programmable biomolecular interaction modalities.",

        "abstract":"Cupredoxins are copper-dependent electron-transfer proteins that can be categorized as blue, purple, green, and red depending on the spectroscopic properties of the Cu(II) bound forms. Interestingly, despite significantly different first coordination spheres and nuclearity, all cupredoxins share a common Greek Key \u03b2-sheet fold. We have previously reported the design of a red copper protein within a completely distinct three-helical bundle protein, \u03b1 3 DChC2. (1) While this design demonstrated that a \u03b2-barrel fold was not requisite to recapitulate the properties of a native cupredoxin center, the parent peptide \u03b1 3 D was not sufficiently stable to allow further study through additional mutations. Here we present the design of an elongated protein GRAND\u03b1 3 D (GR\u03b1 3 D) with \u0394 G u  = -11.4 kcal\/mol compared to the original design's -5.1 kcal\/mol. Diffraction quality crystals were grown of GR\u03b1 3 D (a first for an \u03b1 3 D peptide) and solved to a resolution of 1.34 \u00c5. Examination of this structure suggested that Glu41 might interact with the Cu in our previously reported red copper protein. The previous bis(histidine)(cysteine) site (GR\u03b1 3 DChC2) was designed into this new scaffold and a series of variant constructs were made to explore this hypothesis. Mutation studies around Glu41 not only prove the proposed interaction, but also enabled tuning of the constructs' hyperfine coupling constant from 160 to 127 \u00d7 10 -4  cm -1 . X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis is consistent with these hyperfine coupling differences being the result of variant 4p mixing related to coordination geometry changes. These studies not only prove that an Glu41-Cu interaction leads to the \u03b1 3 DChC2 construct's red copper protein like spectral properties, but also exemplify the exact control one can have in a de novo construct to tune the properties of an electron-transfer Cu site.",

        "abstract":"\u03b2-sheet proteins carry out critical functions in biology, and hence are attractive scaffolds for computational protein design. Despite this potential, de novo design of all-\u03b2-sheet proteins from first principles lags far behind the design of all-\u03b1 or mixed-\u03b1\u03b2 domains owing to their non-local nature and the tendency of exposed \u03b2-strand edges to aggregate. Through study of loops connecting unpaired \u03b2-strands (\u03b2-arches), we have identified a series of structural relationships between loop geometry, side chain directionality and \u03b2-strand length that arise from hydrogen bonding and packing constraints on regular \u03b2-sheet structures. We use these rules to de novo design jellyroll structures with double-stranded \u03b2-helices formed by eight antiparallel \u03b2-strands. The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of a hyperthermostable design closely matched the computational model, demonstrating accurate control over the \u03b2-sheet structure and loop geometry. Our results open the door to the design of a broad range of non-local \u03b2-sheet protein structures.",

        "abstract":"Serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins), typically fold to a metastable native state and undergo a major conformational change in order to inhibit target proteases. However, conformational lability of the native serpin fold renders them susceptible to misfolding and aggregation, and underlies misfolding diseases such as \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin deficiency. Serpin specificity towards its protease target is dictated by its flexible and solvent exposed reactive centre loop (RCL), which forms the initial interaction with the target protease during inhibition. Previous studies have attempted to alter the specificity by mutating the RCL to that of a target serpin, but the rules governing specificity are not understood well enough yet to enable specificity to be engineered at will. In this paper, we use conserpin, a synthetic, thermostable serpin, as a model protein with which to investigate the determinants of serpin specificity by engineering its RCL. Replacing the RCL sequence with that from \u03b11-antitrypsin fails to restore specificity against trypsin or human neutrophil elastase. Structural determination of the RCL-engineered conserpin and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that, although the RCL sequence may partially dictate specificity, local electrostatics and RCL dynamics may dictate the rate of insertion during protease inhibition, and thus whether it behaves as an inhibitor or a substrate. Engineering serpin specificity is therefore substantially more complex than solely manipulating the RCL sequence, and will require a more thorough understanding of how conformational dynamics achieves the delicate balance between stability, folding and function required by the exquisite serpin mechanism of action.",

        "abstract":"Modular self-assembly of biomolecules in two dimensions (2D) is straightforward with DNA but has been difficult to realize with proteins, due to the lack of modular specificity similar to Watson-Crick base pairing. Here we describe a general approach to design 2D arrays using de novo designed pseudosymmetric protein building blocks. A homodimeric helical bundle was reconnected into a monomeric building block, and the surface was redesigned in Rosetta to enable self-assembly into a 2D array in the C12 layer symmetry group. Two out of ten designed arrays assembled to micrometer scale under negative stain electron microscopy, and displayed the designed lattice geometry with assembly size up to 100 nm under atomic force microscopy. The design of 2D arrays with pseudosymmetric building blocks is an important step toward the design of programmable protein self-assembly via pseudosymmetric patterning of orthogonal binding interfaces.",

        "abstract":"\u03b2-propeller proteins are highly symmetrical, being composed of a repeated motif with four anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets arranged around a central axis. Recently we designed the first completely symmetrical \u03b2-propeller protein, Pizza6, consisting of six identical tandem repeats. Pizza6 is expected to prove a useful building block for bionanotechnology, and also a tool to investigate the folding and evolution of \u03b2-propeller proteins. Folding studies are made difficult by the high stability and the lack of buried Trp residues to act as monitor fluorophores, so we have designed and characterized several Trp-containing Pizza6 derivatives. In total four proteins were designed, of which three could be purified and characterized. Crystal structures confirm these mutant proteins maintain the expected structure, and a clear redshift of Trp fluorescence emission could be observed upon denaturation. Among the derivative proteins, Pizza6-AYW appears to be the most suitable model protein for future folding\/unfolding kinetics studies as it has a comparable stability as natural \u03b2-propeller proteins.",

While many of these versatile small proteins can be expressed both in the intracellular and extracellular milieu in cultured cells and in living organisms, they can also be functionalized by fusing them to different protein domains in order to regulate or modulate their target proteins in diverse manners. For example, protein binders have been employed to degrade, trap, localize or enzymatically modify specific target proteins. Whereas binders to many endogenous proteins or small protein tags have been generated, several affinity reagents against fluorescent proteins have also been created and used to manipulate target proteins tagged with the corresponding fluorescent protein.

While binders against GFP and mCherry have been previously isolated and validated, we now report the generation and utilization of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) against the monomeric teal fluorescent protein 1 (mTFP1). Here we use the generated DARPins to delocalize Rab proteins to the nuclear compartment, in which they cannot fulfil their regular functions anymore.

        "abstract":"Designing peptides that fold and assemble in response to metal ions tests our understanding of how peptide folding and metal binding influence one another. Here, histidine residues are introduced into the hydrophobic core of a coiled-coil trimer, generating a peptide that self-assembles upon the addition of metal ions. HisAD, the resulting peptide, is unstructured in the absence of metal and folds selectively to form an \u03b1-helical construct upon complexation with Cu(ii) and Ni(ii) but not Co(ii) or Zn(ii). The structure, and metal-binding ability, of HisAD is probed using a combination of circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. These show the peptide is trimeric and binds to both Cu(ii) and Ni(ii) in a 1\u2009:\u20091 ratio with the histidine residues involved in the metal coordination, as designed. The X-ray crystal structure of the HisAD-Cu(ii) complex reveals the trimeric HisAD peptide coordinates three Cu(ii) ions; this is the first example of such a structure. Additionally, HisAD demonstrates an unprecedented discrimination between transition metal ions, the basis of which is likely to be related to the stability of the peptide-metal complexes formed.",

        "abstract":"The \u03b2-propeller fold is adopted by a sequentially diverse family of repeat proteins with apparent rotational symmetry. While the structure is mostly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, an additional stabilization is provided by hydrogen bonds between the N-and C-termini, which are almost invariably part of the same \u03b2-sheet. This feature is often referred to as the \"Velcro\" closure. The positioning of the termini within a blade is variable and depends on the protein family. In order to investigate the influence of this location on protein structure, folding and stability, we created different circular permutants, and a circularized version, of the designer propeller protein named Pizza. This protein is perfectly symmetrical, possessing six identical repeats. While all mutants adopt the same structure, the proteins lacking the \"Velcro\" closure were found to be significantly less resistant to thermal and chemical denaturation. This could explain why such proteins are rarely observed in nature. Interestingly the most common \"Velcro\" configuration for this protein family was not the most stable among the Pizza variants tested. The circularized version shows dramatically improved stability, which could have implications for future applications.",

        "abstract":"Recently, we designed and assembled protein nanobuilding blocks (PN-Blocks) from an intermolecularly folded dimeric  de novo  protein called WA20. Using this dimeric 4-helix bundle, we constructed a series of self-assembling supramolecular nanostructures including polyhedra and chain-type complexes. Here we describe the stabilization of WA20 by designing mutations that stabilize the helices and hydrophobic core. The redesigned proteins denature with substantially higher midpoints, with the most stable variant, called Super WA20 (SUWA), displaying an extremely high midpoint ( T  m  = 122 \u00b0C), much higher than the  T  m  of WA20 (75 \u00b0C). The crystal structure of SUWA reveals an intermolecularly folded dimer with bisecting U topology, similar to the parental WA20 structure, with two long \u03b1-helices of a protomer intertwined with the helices of another protomer. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the redesigned hydrophobic core in the center of SUWA significantly suppresses the deformation of helices observed in the same region of WA20, suggesting this is a critical factor stabilizing the SUWA structure. This hyperstable  de novo  protein is expected to be useful as nanoscale pillars of PN-Block components in new types of self-assembling nanoarchitectures.",

        "abstract":"Three-stranded coiled coils are peptide structures constructed from amphipathic heptad repeats. Here we show that it is possible to form pure heterotrimeric three-stranded coiled coils by combining three distinct characteristics: (1) a cysteine sulfur layer for metal coordination, (2) a thiophilic, trigonal pyramidal metalloid (Pb(II)) that binds to these sulfurs and (3) an adjacent layer of reduced steric bulk generating a cavity where water can hydrogen bond to the cysteine sulfur atoms. Cysteine substitution in an a site yields Pb(II)A 2 B heterotrimers, while d sites provide pure Pb(II)C 2 D or Pb(II)CD 2  scaffolds. Altering the metal from Pb(II) to Hg(II) or shifting the relative position of the sterically less demanding layer removes heterotrimer specificity. Because only two of the eight or ten hydrophobic layers are perturbed, catalytic sites can be introduced at other regions of the scaffold. A Zn(II)(histidine) 3 (H 2 O) centre can be incorporated at a remote location without perturbing the heterotrimer selectivity, suggesting a unique strategy to prepare dissymmetric catalytic sites within self-assembling de novo-designed proteins.",

        "abstract":"The features that stabilize the structures of membrane proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain packing in membranes. Disruption of steric packing can destabilize the native folds of membrane proteins, but is packing alone sufficient to drive folding in lipids? If so, then membrane proteins stabilized by this feature should be readily designed and structurally characterized-yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and redesign of variants, we define a steric packing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic membrane proteins designed using this code and stabilized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended fold. Although highly stable, the steric complementarity required for their folding is surprisingly stringent. Structural informatics shows that the designed packing motif recurs across the proteome, emphasizing a prominent role for precise apolar packing in membrane protein folding, stabilization, and evolution.",

        "abstract":"Online citizen science projects such as GalaxyZoo 1 , Eyewire 2  and Phylo 3  have proven very successful for data collection, annotation and processing, but for the most part have harnessed human pattern-recognition skills rather than human creativity. An exception is the game EteRNA 4 , in which game players learn to build new RNA structures by exploring the discrete two-dimensional space of Watson-Crick base pairing possibilities. Building new proteins, however, is a more challenging task to present in a game, as both the representation and evaluation of a protein structure are intrinsically three-dimensional. We posed the challenge of de novo protein design in the online protein-folding game Foldit 5 . Players were presented with a fully extended peptide chain and challenged to craft a folded protein structure and an amino acid sequence encoding that structure. After many iterations of player design, analysis of the top-scoring solutions and subsequent game improvement, Foldit players can now-starting from an extended polypeptide chain-generate a diversity of protein structures and sequences that encode them in silico. One hundred forty-six Foldit player designs with sequences unrelated to naturally occurring proteins were encoded in synthetic genes; 56 were found to be expressed and soluble in Escherichia coli, and to adopt stable monomeric folded structures in solution. The diversity of these structures is unprecedented in de novo protein design, representing 20 different folds-including a new fold not observed in natural proteins. High-resolution structures were determined for four of the designs, and are nearly identical to the player models. This work makes explicit the considerable implicit knowledge\u00a0that contributes to success in de novo protein design, and shows that citizen scientists can discover creative new solutions to outstanding scientific challenges such as the protein design problem.",

        "abstract":"The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function. Although there have been advances in the de novo design of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the design of conformational switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to design pH-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond networks. We design homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above pH 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the pH is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition pH and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydrophobic interactions. Upon disassembly, the designed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein design.",

        "abstract":"The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function. Although there have been advances in the de novo design of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the design of conformational switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to design pH-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond networks. We design homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above pH 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the pH is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition pH and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydrophobic interactions. Upon disassembly, the designed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein design.",

        "abstract":"Online citizen science projects such as GalaxyZoo 1 , Eyewire 2  and Phylo 3  have proven very successful for data collection, annotation and processing, but for the most part have harnessed human pattern-recognition skills rather than human creativity. An exception is the game EteRNA 4 , in which game players learn to build new RNA structures by exploring the discrete two-dimensional space of Watson-Crick base pairing possibilities. Building new proteins, however, is a more challenging task to present in a game, as both the representation and evaluation of a protein structure are intrinsically three-dimensional. We posed the challenge of de novo protein design in the online protein-folding game Foldit 5 . Players were presented with a fully extended peptide chain and challenged to craft a folded protein structure and an amino acid sequence encoding that structure. After many iterations of player design, analysis of the top-scoring solutions and subsequent game improvement, Foldit players can now-starting from an extended polypeptide chain-generate a diversity of protein structures and sequences that encode them in silico. One hundred forty-six Foldit player designs with sequences unrelated to naturally occurring proteins were encoded in synthetic genes; 56 were found to be expressed and soluble in Escherichia coli, and to adopt stable monomeric folded structures in solution. The diversity of these structures is unprecedented in de novo protein design, representing 20 different folds-including a new fold not observed in natural proteins. High-resolution structures were determined for four of the designs, and are nearly identical to the player models. This work makes explicit the considerable implicit knowledge\u00a0that contributes to success in de novo protein design, and shows that citizen scientists can discover creative new solutions to outstanding scientific challenges such as the protein design problem.",

        "abstract":"Transmembrane channels and pores have key roles in fundamental biological processes 1  and in biotechnological applications such as DNA nanopore sequencing 2-4 , resulting in considerable interest in the design of pore-containing proteins. Synthetic amphiphilic peptides have been found to form ion channels 5,6 , and there have been recent advances in de novo membrane protein design 7,8  and in redesigning naturally occurring channel-containing proteins 9,10 . However, the de novo design of stable, well-defined transmembrane protein pores that are capable of conducting ions selectively or are large enough to enable the passage of small-molecule fluorophores remains an outstanding challenge 11,12 . Here we report the computational design of protein pores formed by two concentric rings of \u03b1-helices that are stable and monodisperse in both their water-soluble and their transmembrane forms. Crystal structures of the water-soluble forms of a 12-helical pore and a 16-helical pore closely match the computational design models. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments show that, when expressed in insect cells, the transmembrane form of the 12-helix pore enables the passage of ions across the membrane with high selectivity for potassium over sodium; ion passage is blocked by specific chemical modification at the pore entrance. When incorporated into liposomes using in vitro protein synthesis, the transmembrane form of the 16-helix pore-but not the 12-helix pore-enables the passage of biotinylated Alexa Fluor 488. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 16-helix transmembrane pore closely matches the design model. The ability to produce structurally and functionally well-defined transmembrane pores opens the door to the creation of designer channels and pores for a wide variety of applications.",

        "abstract":"Amyloids adopt 'cross-\u03b2' structures composed of long, twisted fibrils with \u03b2-strands running perpendicular to the fibril axis. Recently, a toxic peptide was proposed to form amyloid-like cross-\u03b1 structures in solution, with a planar bilayer-like assembly observed in the crystal structure. Here we crystallographically characterize designed peptides that assemble into spiraling cross-\u03b1 amyloid-like structures, which resemble twisted \u03b2-amyloid fibrils. The peptides form helical dimers, stabilized by packing of small and apolar residues, and the dimers further assemble into cross-\u03b1 amyloid-like fibrils with superhelical pitches ranging from 170\u2009\u00c5 to 200\u2009\u00c5. When a small residue that appeared critical for packing was converted to leucine, it resulted in structural rearrangement to a helical polymer. Fluorescently tagged versions of the designed peptides form puncta in mammalian cells, which recover from photobleaching with markedly different kinetics. These structural folds could be potentially useful for directing in vivo protein assemblies with predetermined spacing and stabilities.",

The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair.

The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair. Our results highlight the exquisite complexity and surprising long-range synergistic interactions among  b -,  c -, and  f -position residues within helix bundles, suggesting new possibilities for engineering hyperstable helix bundles and emphasizing the need to consider carefully the impact of substitutions at these positions for application-specific purposes.",

        "abstract":"Hydrophobic interactions govern how proteins fold and interact with other molecules, but the impact of nearby polar functionality on the effective hydrophobicity of nonpolar surfaces remains unclear. Here we use a common protein quaternary structure motif, the parallel coiled-coil dimer, to ask whether the identity of basic residues (arginine vs lysine; guanidinium vs ammonium) arrayed along one side of the constituent \u03b1-helices influences the favorability of dimerization driven by burial of hydrophobic surface on the other side of each helix. Significant sequence redesign was necessary to achieve the desired juxtaposition of nonpolar and cationic functionality, because we needed to eliminate charged side chains from positions flanking the nonpolar helix surface. Natural and designed sequences that form coiled coils are almost universally rich in acidic and basic residues at these flanking positions. Our arginine coiled-coil dimer was moderately more stable than the lysine analogue, which contrasts with behavior previously observed with helical \u03b2-amino acid oligomers bearing guanidinium versus ammonium groups. We attribute this backbone-dependent difference to variations in the extent to which the helical propensities of \u03b1- and \u03b2-residues can be modulated by design. These findings highlight the challenge of identifying noncovalent forces that direct structure formed by a flexible backbone.",

        "abstract":"Here we show that a solvent-exposed  f -position (i.e., residue 14) within a well-characterized trimeric helix bundle can facilitate a stabilizing long-range synergistic interaction involving  b -position Glu10 (i.e.,  i  - 4 relative to residue 14) and  c -position Lys18 (i.e.,  i  + 4), depending the identity of residue 14. The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair. Our results highlight the exquisite complexity and surprising long-range synergistic interactions among  b -,  c -, and  f -position residues within helix bundles, suggesting new possibilities for engineering hyperstable helix bundles and emphasizing the need to consider carefully the impact of substitutions at these positions for application-specific purposes.",

Association states above this are known, as are antiparallel and mixed arrangements of the helices. However, these alternative states are less well understood. Here, we describe a synthetic-peptide system that switches between parallel hexamers and various up-down-up-down tetramers in response to single-amino-acid changes and solution conditions. The main accessible states of each peptide variant are characterized fully in solution and, in most cases, to high resolution with X-ray crystal structures. Analysis and inspection of these structures helps rationalize the different states formed. This navigation of the structural landscape of \u03b1-helical coiled coils above the dimers and trimers that dominate in nature has allowed us to design rationally a well-defined and hyperstable antiparallel coiled-coil tetramer (apCC-Tet). This robust de novo protein provides another scaffold for further structural and functional designs in protein engineering and synthetic biology.",

        "abstract":"Engineered protein scaffolds are an alternative to monoclonal antibodies in research and drug design due to their small size, ease of production, versatility, and specificity for chosen targets. One key consideration when engineering such proteins is retaining the original scaffold structure and stability upon insertion of target-binding loops. SQT is a stefin A derived scaffold protein that was used as a model to study possible problems associated with solution behaviour of such aptamers. We used an SQT variant with AU1 and Myc insertion peptides (SQT-1C) to study the effect of peptide insertions on protein structure and oligomerisation. The X-ray structure of monomeric SQT-1C revealed a cystatin-like fold. Furthermore, we show that SQT-1C readily forms dimers and tetramers in solution. NMR revealed that these oligomers are symmetrical, with inserted loops comprising the interaction interface. Two possible mechanisms of oligomerisation are compared using molecular dynamics simulations, with domain swap oligomerisation being thermodynamically favoured. We show that retained secondary structure upon peptide insertion is not indicative of unaltered 3D structure and solution behaviour. Therefore, additional methods should be employed to comprehensively assess the consequences of peptide insertions in all aptamers, particularly as uncharacterized oligomerisation may alter binding epitope presentation and affect functional efficiency.",

Here, we present the discovery of a 16-mer cyclic peptide that binds to Cdc42 with nanomolar affinity. Affinity maturation of this sequence has produced a panel of derived candidates with increased affinity and modulated specificity for other closely-related small GTPases. The structure of the tightest binding peptide was solved by NMR, and its binding site on Cdc42 was determined. Addition of a cell-penetrating sequence allowed the peptides to access the cell interior and engage with their target(s), modulating signaling pathways. In Ras-driven cancer cell models, the peptides have an inhibitory effect on proliferation and show suppression of both invasion and motility. As such, they represent promising candidates for Rho-family small GTPase inhibitors and therapeutics targeting Ras-driven cancers. Our data add to the growing literature demonstrating that peptides are establishing their place in the biologics arm of drug discovery.",

        "abstract":"We developed an artificial hydrolase based on the symmetrical Pizza6 \u03b2-propeller protein for the metal-free hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl acetate and butyrate. Through site-specific mutagenesis and crystallisation studies, the catalytic mechanism was investigated and found to be dependent on a threonine-histidine dyad. The mutant with additional histidine residues generated the highest kcat values, forming a His-His-Thr triad and matched previously reported metalloenzymes. The highly symmetrical \u03b2-propeller artificial enzymes and their protein-metal complexes have potential to be utilised in bioinorganic and supramolecular chemistry, as well as being developed further into 2D\/3D catalytic materials.",

        "abstract":"Designed armadillo repeat proteins (dArmRPs) bind extended peptides in a modular way. The consensus version recognises alternating arginines and lysines, with one dipeptide per repeat. For generating new binding specificities, the rapid and robust analysis by crystallography is key. Yet, we have previously found that crystal contacts can strongly influence this analysis, by displacing the peptide and potentially distorting the overall geometry of the scaffold. Therefore, we now used protein design to minimise these effects and expand the previously described concept of shared helices to rigidly connect dArmRPs and designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), which serve as a crystallisation chaperone. To shield the peptide-binding surface from crystal contacts, we rigidly fused two DARPins to the N- and C-terminal repeat of the dArmRP and linked the two DARPins by a disulfide bond. In this ring-like structure, peptide binding, on the inside of the ring, is very regular and undistorted, highlighting the truly modular binding mode. Thus, protein design was utilised to construct a well crystallising scaffold that prevents interference from crystal contacts with peptide binding and maintains the equilibrium structure of the dArmRP. Rigid DARPin-dArmRPs fusions will also be useful when chimeric binding proteins with predefined geometries are required.",

The consensus version recognises alternating arginines and lysines, with one dipeptide per repeat. For generating new binding specificities, the rapid and robust analysis by crystallography is key. Yet, we have previously found that crystal contacts can strongly influence this analysis, by displacing the peptide and potentially distorting the overall geometry of the scaffold. Therefore, we now used protein design to minimise these effects and expand the previously described concept of shared helices to rigidly connect dArmRPs and designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), which serve as a crystallisation chaperone. To shield the peptide-binding surface from crystal contacts, we rigidly fused two DARPins to the N- and C-terminal repeat of the dArmRP and linked the two DARPins by a disulfide bond. In this ring-like structure, peptide binding, on the inside of the ring, is very regular and undistorted, highlighting the truly modular binding mode. Thus, protein design was utilised to construct a well crystallising scaffold that prevents interference from crystal contacts with peptide binding and maintains the equilibrium structure of the dArmRP. Rigid DARPin-dArmRPs fusions will also be useful when chimeric binding proteins with predefined geometries are required.",

This size diversity can be explained by the evolutionary process of gene duplication and fusion. In this study, we investigated a distorted \u03b2-propeller protein, an apparent intermediate between two symmetries. From this template, we created a perfectly symmetric 9-bladed \u03b2-propeller named Cake, using computational design and ancestral sequence reconstruction. The designed repeat sequence was found to be capable of generating both 8-fold and 9-fold propellers which are highly stable. Cake variants with 2-10 identical copies of the repeat sequence were characterised by X-ray crystallography and in solution. They were found to be highly stable, and to self-assemble into 8- or 9-fold symmetrical propellers. These findings show that the \u03b2-propeller fold allows sufficient structural plasticity to permit a given blade to assemble different forms, a transition from even to odd changes in blade number, and provide a potential explanation for the wide diversity of repeat numbers observed in natural propeller proteins.

        "abstract":"\u03b2-propeller proteins are common in nature, where they are observed to adopt 4- to 10-fold internal rotational pseudo-symmetry. This size diversity can be explained by the evolutionary process of gene duplication and fusion. In this study, we investigated a distorted \u03b2-propeller protein, an apparent intermediate between two symmetries. From this template, we created a perfectly symmetric 9-bladed \u03b2-propeller named Cake, using computational design and ancestral sequence reconstruction. The designed repeat sequence was found to be capable of generating both 8-fold and 9-fold propellers which are highly stable. Cake variants with 2-10 identical copies of the repeat sequence were characterised by X-ray crystallography and in solution. They were found to be highly stable, and to self-assemble into 8- or 9-fold symmetrical propellers. These findings show that the \u03b2-propeller fold allows sufficient structural plasticity to permit a given blade to assemble different forms, a transition from even to odd changes in blade number, and provide a potential explanation for the wide diversity of repeat numbers observed in natural propeller proteins.

However, current structure-based methods are largely limited to natural peptides and are not suitable for designing bioactive cyclic topologies that go beyond natural l-amino acids. Here, we report a generalizable framework that exploits the computational power of Rosetta, in terms of large-scale backbone sampling, side-chain composition and energy scoring, to design heterochiral cyclic peptides that bind to a protein surface of interest. To showcase the applicability of our approach, we developed two new inhibitors ( PD-i3  and  PD-i6 ) of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), a key immune checkpoint in oncology. A comprehensive biophysical evaluation was performed to assess their binding to PD-1 as well as their blocking effect on the endogenous PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction. Finally, NMR elucidation of their in-solution structures confirmed our  de novo  design approach.",

        "abstract":"Here we show that a solvent-exposed  f -position (i.e., residue 14) within a well-characterized trimeric helix bundle can facilitate a stabilizing long-range synergistic interaction involving  b -position Glu10 (i.e.,  i  - 4 relative to residue 14) and  c -position Lys18 (i.e.,  i  + 4), depending the identity of residue 14. The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair. Our results highlight the exquisite complexity and surprising long-range synergistic interactions among  b -,  c -, and  f -position residues within helix bundles, suggesting new possibilities for engineering hyperstable helix bundles and emphasizing the need to consider carefully the impact of substitutions at these positions for application-specific purposes.",

Crystal structures of an S4-symmetric macrocycle (consisting of a sequence and structure segment mirrored at each of three successive repeats) designed to bind zinc reveal a large-scale zinc-driven conformational change from an S4-symmetric apo-state to a nearly inverted S4-symmetric holo-state almost identical to the design model. These symmetric structures provide promising starting points for applications ranging from design of cyclic peptide based metal organic frameworks to creation of high affinity binders of symmetric protein homo-oligomers. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of computational design for exploring symmetries and structures not found in nature, and for creating synthetic switchable systems.",

Here we describe the computational design of mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles with rigid structures that feature internal cyclic symmetries or improper rotational symmetries inaccessible to natural proteins.

Crystal structures of an S4-symmetric macrocycle (consisting of a sequence and structure segment mirrored at each of three successive repeats) designed to bind zinc reveal a large-scale zinc-driven conformational change from an S4-symmetric apo-state to a nearly inverted S4-symmetric holo-state almost identical to the design model. These symmetric structures provide promising starting points for applications ranging from design of cyclic peptide based metal organic frameworks to creation of high affinity binders of symmetric protein homo-oligomers.

The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair. Our results highlight the exquisite complexity and surprising long-range synergistic interactions among  b -,  c -, and  f -position residues within helix bundles, suggesting new possibilities for engineering hyperstable helix bundles and emphasizing the need to consider carefully the impact of substitutions at these positions for application-specific purposes.",

The extent of stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair depends primarily on the presence of a side-chain hydrogen-bond donor at residue 14; the nonpolar or hydrophobic character of residue 14 plays a smaller but still significant role. Crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Glu10 and Lys18 do not interact directly with each other but suggest the possibility that the proximity of residue 14 with Lys18 allows Glu10 to interact favorably with nearby Lys7. Subsequent thermodynamic experiments confirm the important role of Lys7 in the large synergistic stabilization associated with the Glu10-Lys18 pair. Our results highlight the exquisite complexity and surprising long-range synergistic interactions among  b -,  c -, and  f -position residues within helix bundles, suggesting new possibilities for engineering hyperstable helix bundles and emphasizing the need to consider carefully the impact of substitutions at these positions for application-specific purposes.",

        "abstract":"Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expressed on activated T cells inhibits T cell function and proliferation to prevent an excessive immune response, and disease can result if this delicate balance is shifted in either direction. Tumor cells often take advantage of this pathway by overexpressing the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 to evade destruction by the immune system. Alternatively, if there is a decrease in function of the PD-1 pathway, unchecked activation of the immune system and autoimmunity can result. Using a combination of computation and experiment, we designed a hyperstable 40-residue miniprotein, PD-MP1, that specifically binds murine and human PD-1 at the PD-L1 interface with a K d  of \u223c100 nM. The apo crystal structure shows that the binder folds as designed with a backbone RMSD of 1.3 \u00c5 to the design model. Trimerization of PD-MP1 resulted in a PD-1 agonist that strongly inhibits murine T cell activation. This small, hyperstable PD-1 binding protein was computationally designed with an all-beta interface, and the trimeric agonist could contribute to treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract":"Multivalent presentation of viral glycoproteins can substantially increase the elicitation of antigen-specific antibodies. To enable a new generation of anti-viral vaccines, we designed self-assembling protein nanoparticles with geometries tailored to present the ectodomains of influenza, HIV, and RSV viral glycoprotein trimers. We first  de novo  designed trimers tailored for antigen fusion, featuring N-terminal helices positioned to match the C termini of the viral glycoproteins. Trimers that experimentally adopted their designed configurations were incorporated as components of tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticles, which were characterized by cryo-electron microscopy and assessed for their ability to present viral glycoproteins. Electron microscopy and antibody binding experiments demonstrated that the designed nanoparticles presented antigenically intact prefusion HIV-1 Env, influenza hemagglutinin, and RSV F trimers in the predicted geometries. This work demonstrates that antigen-displaying protein nanoparticles can be designed from scratch, and provides a systematic way to investigate the influence of antigen presentation geometry on the immune response to vaccination.",

        "abstract":"Two-component, self-assembling nanoparticles represent a versatile platform for multivalent presentation of viral antigens. Computational design of protein nanoparticles with differing sizes and geometries enables combination with antigens of choice to test novel multimerization concepts in immunization strategies where the goal is to improve the induction and maturation of neutralizing antibody lineages. Here, we describe detailed antigenic, structural, and functional characterization of computationally designed tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticle immunogens displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomains. Env trimers, based on subtype A (BG505) or consensus group M (ConM) sequences and engineered with SOSIP stabilizing mutations, were fused to an underlying trimeric building block of each nanoparticle. Initial screening yielded one icosahedral and two tetrahedral nanoparticle candidates, capable of presenting twenty or four copies of the Env trimer. A number of analyses, including detailed structural characterization by cryo-EM, demonstrated that the nanoparticle immunogens possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties. When the immunogenicity of ConM-SOSIP trimers presented on a two-component tetrahedral nanoparticle or as soluble proteins were compared in rabbits, the two immunogens elicited similar serum antibody binding titers against the trimer component. Neutralizing antibody titers were slightly elevated in the animals given the nanoparticle immunogen and were initially more focused to the trimer apex. Altogether, our findings indicate that tetrahedral nanoparticles can be successfully applied for presentation of HIV Env trimer immunogens; however, the optimal implementation to different immunization strategies remains to be determined.",

        "abstract":"Following immunization, high-affinity antibody responses develop within germinal centers (GCs), specialized sites within follicles of the lymph node (LN) where B cells proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation. Antigen availability within GCs is important, as B cells must acquire and present antigen to follicular helper T cells to drive this process. However, recombinant protein immunogens such as soluble human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) trimers do not efficiently accumulate in follicles following traditional immunization. Here, we demonstrate two strategies to concentrate HIV Env immunogens in follicles, via the formation of immune complexes (ICs) or by employing self-assembling protein nanoparticles for multivalent display of Env antigens. Using rhesus macaques, we show that within a few days following immunization, free trimers were present in a diffuse pattern in draining LNs, while trimer ICs and Env nanoparticles accumulated in B cell follicles. Whole LN imaging strikingly revealed that ICs and trimer nanoparticles concentrated in as many as 500 follicles in a single LN within two days after immunization. Imaging of LNs collected seven days postimmunization showed that Env nanoparticles persisted on follicular dendritic cells in the light zone of nascent GCs. These findings suggest that the form of antigen administered in vaccination can dramatically impact localization in lymphoid tissues and provides a new rationale for the enhanced immune responses observed following immunization with ICs or nanoparticles.",

        "abstract":"Naturally occurring proteins vary the precise geometries of structural elements to create distinct shapes optimal for function. We present a computational design method, loop-helix-loop unit combinatorial sampling (LUCS), that mimics nature's ability to create families of proteins with the same overall fold but precisely tunable geometries. Through near-exhaustive sampling of loop-helix-loop elements, LUCS generates highly diverse geometries encompassing those found in nature but also surpassing known structure space. Biophysical characterization showed that 17 (38%) of 45 tested LUCS designs encompassing two different structural topologies were well folded, including 16 with designed non-native geometries. Four experimentally solved structures closely matched the designs. LUCS greatly expands the designable structure space and offers a new paradigm for designing proteins with tunable geometries that may be customizable for novel functions.",

Here, we describe the design of two-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates built from de novo-designed proteins. These gates regulate the association of arbitrary protein units ranging from split enzymes to transcriptional machinery in vitro, in yeast and in primary human T cells, where they control the expression of the  TIM3  gene related to T cell exhaustion. Designed binding interaction cooperativity, confirmed by native mass spectrometry, makes the gates largely insensitive to stoichiometric imbalances in the inputs, and the modularity of the approach enables ready extension to three-input OR, AND, and disjunctive normal form gates. The modularity and cooperativity of the control elements, coupled with the ability to de novo design an essentially unlimited number of protein components, should enable the design of sophisticated posttranslational control logic over a wide range of biological functions.",

We use implicit negative design to generate \u03b2 sheet-mediated heterodimers that can be assembled into a wide variety of complexes. The designs are stable, folded, and soluble in isolation and rapidly assemble upon mixing, and crystal structures are close to the computational models. We construct linearly arranged hetero-oligomers with up to six different components, branched hetero-oligomers, closed C4-symmetric two-component rings, and hetero-oligomers assembled on a cyclic homo-oligomeric central hub and demonstrate that such complexes can readily reconfigure through subunit exchange. Our approach provides a general route to designing asymmetric reconfigurable protein systems.",

To enable computational design of binders, we developed a unit of protein structure-a van der Mer (vdM)-that maps the backbone of each amino acid to statistically preferred positions of interacting chemical groups. Using vdMs, we designed six de novo proteins to bind the drug apixaban; two bound with low and submicromolar affinity. X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis confirmed a structure with a precisely designed cavity that forms favorable interactions in the drug-protein complex. vdMs may enable design of functional proteins for applications in sensing, medicine, and catalysis.",

We leverage the power of de novo computational design coupled with a \"hypothesis, design, and test\" approach to determine TMB design principles, notably, the importance of negative design to slow \u03b2-sheet assembly. We design new eight-stranded TMBs, with no homology to known TMBs, that insert and fold reversibly into synthetic lipid membranes and have nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray crystal structures very similar to the computational models. These advances should enable the custom design of pores for a wide range of applications.",

We develop a hierarchical approach to designing multi-component protein assemblies from two classes of modular building blocks: designed helical repeat proteins (DHRs) and helical bundle oligomers (HBs).

We then generate assemblies with cyclic, dihedral, and point group symmetries from these building blocks using architecture guided rigid helical fusion with new software named WORMS. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy characterization show that the hierarchical design approach can accurately generate a wide range of assemblies, including a 43\u2009nm diameter icosahedral nanocage.

        "abstract":"A systematic and robust approach to generating complex protein nanomaterials would have broad utility. We develop a hierarchical approach to designing multi-component protein assemblies from two classes of modular building blocks: designed helical repeat proteins (DHRs) and helical bundle oligomers (HBs). We first rigidly fuse DHRs to HBs to generate a large library of oligomeric building blocks. We then generate assemblies with cyclic, dihedral, and point group symmetries from these building blocks using architecture guided rigid helical fusion with new software named WORMS. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy characterization show that the hierarchical design approach can accurately generate a wide range of assemblies, including a 43\u2009nm diameter icosahedral nanocage. The computational methods and building block sets described here provide a very general route to de novo designed protein nanomaterials.",

However, most de novo proteins lack biological function, presenting a major methodological challenge. In vaccinology, the induction of precise antibody responses remains a cornerstone for next-generation vaccines. Here, we present a protein design algorithm called TopoBuilder, with which we engineered epitope-focused immunogens displaying complex structural motifs. In both mice and nonhuman primates, cocktails of three de novo-designed immunogens induced robust neutralizing responses against the respiratory syncytial virus. Furthermore, the immunogens refocused preexisting antibody responses toward defined neutralization epitopes. Overall, our design approach opens the possibility of targeting specific epitopes for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies and, more generally, will be applicable to the design of de novo proteins displaying complex functional motifs.",

        "abstract":" De novo -designed protein domains are increasingly being applied in biotechnology, cell biology, and synthetic biology. Therefore, it is imperative that these proteins be robust to superficial changes; i.e., small changes to their amino acid sequences should not cause gross structural changes. In turn, this allows properties such as stability and solubility to be tuned without affecting structural attributes like tertiary fold and quaternary interactions. Reliably designed proteins with predictable behaviors may then be used as scaffolds to incorporate function, e.g., through the introduction of features for small-molecule, metal, or macromolecular binding, and enzyme-like active sites. Generally, achieving this requires the starting protein fold to be well understood. Herein, we focus on designing \u03b1-helical coiled coils, which are well studied, widespread, and often direct protein-protein interactions in natural systems. Our initial investigations reveal that a previously designed parallel, homotetrameric coiled coil, CC-Tet, is not robust to sequence changes that were anticipated to maintain its structure. Instead, the alterations switch the oligomeric state from tetramer to trimer. To improve the robustness of designed homotetramers, additional sequences based on CC-Tet were produced and characterized in solution and by X-ray crystallography. Of these updated sequences, one is robust to truncation and to changes in surface electrostatics; we call this CC-Tet*. Variants of the general CC-Tet* design provide a set of homotetrameric coiled coils with unfolding temperatures in the range from 40 to >95 \u00b0C. We anticipate that these will be of use in applications requiring robust and well-defined tetramerization domains.",

        "abstract":" De novo -designed protein domains are increasingly being applied in biotechnology, cell biology, and synthetic biology. Therefore, it is imperative that these proteins be robust to superficial changes; i.e., small changes to their amino acid sequences should not cause gross structural changes. In turn, this allows properties such as stability and solubility to be tuned without affecting structural attributes like tertiary fold and quaternary interactions. Reliably designed proteins with predictable behaviors may then be used as scaffolds to incorporate function, e.g., through the introduction of features for small-molecule, metal, or macromolecular binding, and enzyme-like active sites. Generally, achieving this requires the starting protein fold to be well understood. Herein, we focus on designing \u03b1-helical coiled coils, which are well studied, widespread, and often direct protein-protein interactions in natural systems. Our initial investigations reveal that a previously designed parallel, homotetrameric coiled coil, CC-Tet, is not robust to sequence changes that were anticipated to maintain its structure. Instead, the alterations switch the oligomeric state from tetramer to trimer. To improve the robustness of designed homotetramers, additional sequences based on CC-Tet were produced and characterized in solution and by X-ray crystallography. Of these updated sequences, one is robust to truncation and to changes in surface electrostatics; we call this CC-Tet*. Variants of the general CC-Tet* design provide a set of homotetrameric coiled coils with unfolding temperatures in the range from 40 to >95 \u00b0C. We anticipate that these will be of use in applications requiring robust and well-defined tetramerization domains.",

Specifically, hydrophobic interactions must be designed between the peptides and at the peptide-lipid interfaces simultaneously. Here, we take a multi-step approach towards this problem. First, we use rational de novo design to generate water-soluble \u03b1-helical barrels with polar interiors, and confirm their structures using high-resolution X-ray crystallography. These \u03b1-helical barrels have water-filled lumens like those of transmembrane channels. Next, we modify the sequences to facilitate their insertion into lipid bilayers. Single-channel electrical recordings and fluorescent imaging of the peptides in membranes show monodisperse, cation-selective channels of unitary conductance. Surprisingly, however, an X-ray structure solved from the lipidic cubic phase for one peptide reveals an alternative state with tightly packed helices and a constricted channel. To reconcile these observations, we perform computational analyses to compare the properties of possible different states of the peptide.",

First, we use rational de novo design to generate water-soluble \u03b1-helical barrels with polar interiors, and confirm their structures using high-resolution X-ray crystallography. These \u03b1-helical barrels have water-filled lumens like those of transmembrane channels. Next, we modify the sequences to facilitate their insertion into lipid bilayers. Single-channel electrical recordings and fluorescent imaging of the peptides in membranes show monodisperse, cation-selective channels of unitary conductance. Surprisingly, however, an X-ray structure solved from the lipidic cubic phase for one peptide reveals an alternative state with tightly packed helices and a constricted channel. To reconcile these observations, we perform computational analyses to compare the properties of possible different states of the peptide.",

Here we show that design and directed evolution can be used to transform a non-natural, functionally naive zinc-binding protein into a highly active catalyst for an abiological hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. The artificial metalloenzyme achieves >10 4  turnovers per active site, exerts absolute control over reaction pathway and product stereochemistry, and displays a catalytic proficiency (1\/K TS \u2009=\u20092.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910 10 \u2009M -1 ) that exceeds all previously characterized Diels-Alderases. These properties capitalize on effective Lewis acid catalysis, a chemical strategy for accelerating Diels-Alder reactions common in the laboratory but so far unknown in nature. Extension of this approach to other metal ions and other de novo scaffolds may propel the design field in exciting new directions.",

Understanding and manipulating protein stability provide crucial information on the molecular determinants that modulate structure and stability, and expand the applications of de novo proteins. Since the (\u03b2\/\u237a) 8 -barrel or TIM-barrel fold is one of the most common functional scaffolds, in this work we designed a collection of stable de novo TIM barrels (DeNovoTIMs), using a computational fixed-backbone and modular approach based on improved hydrophobic packing of sTIM11, the first validated de novo TIM barrel, and subjected them to a thorough folding analysis. DeNovoTIMs navigate a region of the stability landscape previously uncharted by natural TIM barrels, with variations spanning 60 degrees in melting temperature and 22\u00a0kcal per mol in conformational stability throughout the designs. Significant non-additive or epistatic effects were observed when stabilizing mutations from different regions of the barrel were combined. The molecular basis of epistasis in DeNovoTIMs appears to be related to the extension of the hydrophobic cores. This study is an important step towards the fine-tuned modulation of protein stability by design.",

        "abstract":"The ability to design stable proteins with custom-made functions is a major goal in biochemistry with practical relevance for our environment and society. Understanding and manipulating protein stability provide crucial information on the molecular determinants that modulate structure and stability, and expand the applications of de novo proteins. Since the (\u03b2\/\u237a) 8 -barrel or TIM-barrel fold is one of the most common functional scaffolds, in this work we designed a collection of stable de novo TIM barrels (DeNovoTIMs), using a computational fixed-backbone and modular approach based on improved hydrophobic packing of sTIM11, the first validated de novo TIM barrel, and subjected them to a thorough folding analysis. DeNovoTIMs navigate a region of the stability landscape previously uncharted by natural TIM barrels, with variations spanning 60 degrees in melting temperature and 22\u00a0kcal per mol in conformational stability throughout the designs. Significant non-additive or epistatic effects were observed when stabilizing mutations from different regions of the barrel were combined. The molecular basis of epistasis in DeNovoTIMs appears to be related to the extension of the hydrophobic cores. This study is an important step towards the fine-tuned modulation of protein stability by design.",

Yet charged networks within the central protein core are often indispensable for the biological function. Here, we show that natural buried ion-pairs are stabilised by amphiphilic residues that electrostatically shield the charged motif from its surroundings to gain structural stability. To explore this effect, we build artificial proteins with buried ion-pairs by combining directed computational design and biophysical experiments. Our findings illustrate how perturbation in charged networks can introduce structural rearrangements to compensate for desolvation effects. We validate the physical principles by resolving high-resolution atomic structures of the artificial proteins that are resistant towards unfolding at extreme temperatures and harsh chemical conditions. Our findings provide a molecular understanding of functional charged networks and how point mutations may alter the protein's conformational landscape.",

Here we report a de novo designed peptide that forms multiple \u03b1-helical-bundle states that are accessible and interconvertible under the same conditions. Usually in such designs amphipathic \u03b1 helices associate to form compact structures with consolidated hydrophobic cores. However, recent rational and computational designs have delivered open \u03b1-helical barrels with functionalisable cavities. By placing glycine judiciously in the helical interfaces of an \u03b1-helical barrel, we obtain both open and compact states in a single protein crystal. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate a free-energy landscape with multiple and interconverting states. Together, these findings suggest a frustrated system in which steric interactions that maintain the open barrel and the hydrophobic effect that drives complete collapse are traded-off. Indeed, addition of a hydrophobic co-solvent that can bind within the barrel affects the switch between the states both in silico and experimentally.",

The long, often flexible loops that form such cavities in many natural proteins are difficult to precisely program and thus challenging for computational protein design. Here we describe an alternative approach to this problem. We fused two stable proteins with C2 symmetry-a de novo designed dimeric ferredoxin fold and a de novo designed TIM barrel-such that their symmetry axes are aligned to create scaffolds with large cavities that can serve as binding pockets or enzymatic reaction chambers. The crystal structures of two such designs confirm the presence of a 420 cubic \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m chamber defined by the top of the designed TIM barrel and the bottom of the ferredoxin dimer. We functionalized the scaffold by installing a metal-binding site consisting of four glutamate residues close to the symmetry axis. The protein binds lanthanide ions with very high affinity as demonstrated by tryptophan-enhanced terbium luminescence. This approach can be extended to other metals and cofactors, making this scaffold a modular platform for the design of binding proteins and biocatalysts.",

        "abstract":"The rational design of linear peptides that assemble controllably and predictably in water is challenging. Short sequences must encode unique target structures and avoid alternative states. However, the non-covalent forces that stabilize and discriminate between states are weak. Nonetheless, for \u03b1-helical coiled-coil assemblies considerable progress has been made in rational  de novo  design. In these, sequence repeats of nominally hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) residues,  hpphppp , direct the assembly of amphipathic helices into dimeric to tetrameric bundles. Expanding this pattern to  hpphhph  can produce larger \u03b1-helical barrels. Here, we show that pentameric to nonameric barrels are accessed by varying the residue at one of the  h  sites. In peptides with four L\/I-K-E-I-A-x-Z repeats, decreasing the size of Z from threonine to serine to alanine to glycine gives progressively larger oligomers. X-ray crystal structures of the resulting \u03b1-helical barrels rationalize this: side chains at Z point directly into the helical interfaces, and smaller residues allow closer helix contacts and larger assemblies.",

        "abstract":"The ability to construct novel enzymes is a major aim in de novo protein design. A popular enzyme fold for design attempts is the TIM barrel. This fold is a common topology for enzymes and can harbor many diverse reactions. The recent de novo design of a four-fold symmetric TIM barrel provides a well understood minimal scaffold for potential enzyme designs. Here we explore opportunities to extend and diversify this scaffold by adding a short de novo helix on top of the barrel. Due to the size of the protein, we developed a design pipeline based on computational ab initio folding that solves a less complex sub-problem focused around the helix and its vicinity and adapt it to the entire protein. We provide biochemical characterization and a high-resolution X-ray structure for one variant and compare it to our design model. The successful extension of this robust TIM-barrel scaffold opens opportunities to diversify it towards more pocket like arrangements and as such can be considered a building block for future design of binding or catalytic sites.",

Here, we report the characterization and structure of a de novo diheme \"maquette\" protein, 4D2, which we subsequently use to create an expanded, modular platform for heme protein design. A well-folded monoheme variant was created by computational redesign, which was then utilized for the experimental validation of continuum electrostatic redox potential calculations. This demonstrates how fundamental biophysical properties can be predicted and fine-tuned. 4D2 was then extended into a tetraheme helical bundle, representing a 7 nm molecular wire. Despite a molecular weight of only 24 kDa, electron cryomicroscopy illustrated a remarkable level of detail, indicating the positioning of the secondary structure and the heme cofactors. This robust, expressible, highly thermostable and readily designable modular platform presents a valuable resource for redox protein design and the future construction of artificial electron-conducting circuitry.",

        "abstract":"The design of catalytic proteins with functional sites capable of specific chemistry is gaining momentum and a number of artificial enzymes have recently been reported, including hydrolases, oxidoreductases, retro-aldolases, and others. Our goal is to develop a peptide ligase for robust catalysis of amide bond formation that possesses no stringent restrictions to the amino acid composition at the ligation junction. We report here the successful completion of the first step in this long-term project by building a completely de novo protein with predefined acyl transfer catalytic activity. We applied a minimalist approach to rationally design an oxyanion hole within a small cavity that contains an adjacent thiol nucleophile. The N-terminus of the \u03b1-helix with unpaired hydrogen-bond donors was exploited as a structural motif to stabilize negatively charged tetrahedral intermediates in nucleophilic addition-elimination reactions at the acyl group. Cysteine acting as a principal catalytic residue was introduced at the second residue position of the \u03b1-helix N-terminus in a designed three-\u03b1-helix protein based on structural informatics prediction. We showed that this minimal set of functional elements is sufficient for the emergence of catalytic activity in a de novo protein. Using peptide- \u03b1 thioesters as acyl-donors, we demonstrated their catalyzed amidation concomitant with hydrolysis and proved that the environment at the catalytic site critically influences the reaction outcome. These results represent a promising starting point for the development of efficient catalysts for protein labeling, conjugation, and peptide ligation.",

So far, 4- to 12-bladed [Formula: see text]-propellers have been discovered in nature showing large functional and sequential variation. Using computational design approaches, we created perfectly symmetric [Formula: see text]-propellers out of natural pseudo-symmetric templates. These proteins are useful tools to study protein evolution of this very diverse fold. While the 7-bladed architecture is the most common, no symmetric 7-bladed monomer has been created and characterized so far. Here we describe such a engineered protein, based on a highly symmetric natural template, and test the effects of circular permutation on its stability. Geometrical analysis of this protein and other artificial symmetrical proteins reveals no systematic constraint that could be used to help in engineering of this fold, and suggests sequence constraints unique to each [Formula: see text]-propeller sub-family.",

        "abstract":"The rational design of linear peptides that assemble controllably and predictably in water is challenging. Short sequences must encode unique target structures and avoid alternative states. However, the non-covalent forces that stabilize and discriminate between states are weak. Nonetheless, for \u03b1-helical coiled-coil assemblies considerable progress has been made in rational  de novo  design. In these, sequence repeats of nominally hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) residues,  hpphppp , direct the assembly of amphipathic helices into dimeric to tetrameric bundles. Expanding this pattern to  hpphhph  can produce larger \u03b1-helical barrels. Here, we show that pentameric to nonameric barrels are accessed by varying the residue at one of the  h  sites. In peptides with four L\/I-K-E-I-A-x-Z repeats, decreasing the size of Z from threonine to serine to alanine to glycine gives progressively larger oligomers. X-ray crystal structures of the resulting \u03b1-helical barrels rationalize this: side chains at Z point directly into the helical interfaces, and smaller residues allow closer helix contacts and larger assemblies.",

        "abstract":"Rational protein design requires understanding the contribution of each amino acid to a targeted protein fold. For a subset of protein structures, namely, \u03b1-helical coiled coils (CCs), knowledge is sufficiently advanced to allow the rational  de novo  design of many structures, including entirely new protein folds. Current CC design rules center on using aliphatic hydrophobic residues predominantly to drive the folding and assembly of amphipathic \u03b1 helices. The consequences of using aromatic residues-which would be useful for introducing structural probes, and binding and catalytic functionalities-into these interfaces are not understood. There are specific examples of designed CCs containing such aromatic residues,  e.g ., phenylalanine-rich sequences, and the use of polar aromatic residues to make buried hydrogen-bond networks. However, it is not known generally if sequences rich in tyrosine can form CCs, or what CC assemblies these would lead to. Here, we explore tyrosine-rich sequences in a general CC-forming background and resolve new CC structures. In one of these, an antiparallel tetramer, the tyrosine residues are solvent accessible and pack at the interface between the core and the surface. In another more complex structure, the residues are buried and form an extended hydrogen-bond network.",

For a subset of protein structures, namely, \u03b1-helical coiled coils (CCs), knowledge is sufficiently advanced to allow the rational  de novo  design of many structures, including entirely new protein folds. Current CC design rules center on using aliphatic hydrophobic residues predominantly to drive the folding and assembly of amphipathic \u03b1 helices. The consequences of using aromatic residues-which would be useful for introducing structural probes, and binding and catalytic functionalities-into these interfaces are not understood. There are specific examples of designed CCs containing such aromatic residues,  e.g ., phenylalanine-rich sequences, and the use of polar aromatic residues to make buried hydrogen-bond networks. However, it is not known generally if sequences rich in tyrosine can form CCs, or what CC assemblies these would lead to. Here, we explore tyrosine-rich sequences in a general CC-forming background and resolve new CC structures. In one of these, an antiparallel tetramer, the tyrosine residues are solvent accessible and pack at the interface between the core and the surface.

Here we show that design and directed evolution can be used to transform a non-natural, functionally naive zinc-binding protein into a highly active catalyst for an abiological hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. The artificial metalloenzyme achieves >10 4  turnovers per active site, exerts absolute control over reaction pathway and product stereochemistry, and displays a catalytic proficiency (1\/K TS \u2009=\u20092.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910 10 \u2009M -1 ) that exceeds all previously characterized Diels-Alderases. These properties capitalize on effective Lewis acid catalysis, a chemical strategy for accelerating Diels-Alder reactions common in the laboratory but so far unknown in nature. Extension of this approach to other metal ions and other de novo scaffolds may propel the design field in exciting new directions.",

        "abstract":"Naturally occurring protein switches have been repurposed for the development of biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications 1 . However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2 . The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the\u00a0severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3 , we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\u00a0and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid\u00a0proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder 4 , has a limit of detection of 15\u00a0pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.",

It has been suggested that the designability of backbones is governed mainly by side chain-independent or side chain type-insensitive molecular interactions 3-5 , indicating an approach for designing new backbones (ready for amino acid selection) based on continuous sampling and optimization of the backbone-centred energy surface. However, a sufficiently comprehensive and precise energy function has yet to be established for this purpose. Here we show that this goal is met by a statistical model named SCUBA (for Side Chain-Unknown Backbone Arrangement) that uses neural network-form energy terms. These terms are learned with a two-step approach that comprises kernel density estimation followed by neural network training and can analytically represent multidimensional, high-order correlations in known protein structures. We report the crystal structures of nine de novo proteins whose backbones were designed to high precision using SCUBA, four of which have novel, non-natural overall architectures. By eschewing use of fragments from existing protein structures, SCUBA-driven structure design facilitates far-reaching exploration of the designable backbone space, thus extending the novelty and diversity of the proteins amenable to de novo design.",

Recently, we developed a uniform supramolecular protein nanoparticle, TIP60, symmmetrically self-assembled from fusion proteins of a pentameric Sm-like protein and a dimeric MyoX-coil domain. Herein, we report the icosahedral 60-meric structure of TIP60 solved using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Interestingly, the structure revealed 20 regular-triangle-like pores on the surface. TIP60 and its mutants have many modifiable sites on their exterior and interior surfaces. The TIP60 architecture will be useful in the development of biomedical and biochemical nanoparticles\/nanocages for future applications.",

The results indicate that protein catalysts with varying levels of directionality in usually reversibly catalyzed aldol and retro-aldol reactions can be generated from the same protein scaffold.",

        "abstract":"Precise cell targeting is challenging because most mammalian cell types lack a single surface marker that distinguishes them from other cells. A solution would be to target cells using specific combinations of proteins present on their surfaces. In this study, we design colocalization-dependent protein switches (Co-LOCKR) that perform AND, OR, and NOT Boolean logic operations. These switches activate through a conformational change only when all conditions are met, generating rapid, transcription-independent responses at single-cell resolution within complex cell populations. We implement AND gates to redirect T cell specificity against tumor cells expressing two surface antigens while avoiding off-target recognition of single-antigen cells, and three-input switches that add NOT or OR logic to avoid or include cells expressing a third antigen. Thus, de novo designed proteins can perform computations on the surface of cells, integrating multiple distinct binding interactions into a single output.",

        "abstract":"We describe the de novo design of an allosterically regulated protein, which comprises two tightly coupled domains. One domain is based on the DF (Due Ferri in Italian or two-iron in English) family of de novo proteins, which have a diiron cofactor that catalyzes a phenol oxidase reaction, while the second domain is based on PS1 (Porphyrin-binding Sequence), which binds a synthetic Zn-porphyrin (ZnP). The binding of ZnP to the original PS1 protein induces changes in structure and dynamics, which we expected to influence the catalytic rate of a fused DF domain when appropriately coupled. Both DF and PS1 are four-helix bundles, but they have distinct bundle architectures. To achieve tight coupling between the domains, they were connected by four helical linkers using a computational method to discover the most designable connections capable of spanning the two architectures. The resulting protein, DFP1 (Due Ferri Porphyrin), bound the two cofactors in the expected manner. The crystal structure of fully reconstituted DFP1 was also in excellent agreement with the design, and it showed the ZnP cofactor bound over 12 \u00c5 from the dimetal center. Next, a substrate-binding cleft leading to the diiron center was introduced into DFP1. The resulting protein acts as an allosterically modulated phenol oxidase. Its Michaelis-Menten parameters were strongly affected by the binding of ZnP, resulting in a fourfold tighter  K  m  and a 7-fold decrease in  k  cat  These studies establish the feasibility of designing allosterically regulated catalytic proteins, entirely from scratch.",

        "abstract":"There has been considerable recent progress in protein structure prediction using deep neural networks to predict inter-residue distances from amino acid sequences 1-3 . Here we investigate whether the information captured by such networks is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occurring proteins used in training the models. We generate random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting residue-residue distance maps, which, as expected, are quite featureless. We then carry out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence space, optimizing the contrast (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the inter-residue\u00a0distance distributions predicted by the network and background distributions averaged over all proteins. Optimization from different random starting points resulted in novel proteins spanning a wide range of sequences and predicted structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding 129 of the network-'hallucinated' sequences, and expressed and purified the proteins in Escherichia coli; 27 of the proteins yielded monodisperse species with circular dichroism spectra consistent with the hallucinated structures. We determined the three-dimensional\u00a0structures of three of the hallucinated proteins, two by X-ray crystallography and one by NMR, and these closely matched the hallucinated models. Thus, deep networks trained to predict native protein structures from their sequences can be inverted to design new proteins, and such networks and methods should contribute alongside traditional physics-based models to the de novo design of proteins with new functions.",

Stable designs, however, are astronomically rare within the space of all possible amino acid sequences. As a consequence, many designs must be tested computationally and experimentally in order to find stable ones, which is expensive in terms of time and resources. Here we use a high-throughput, low-fidelity assay to experimentally evaluate the stability of approximately 200,000 novel proteins. These include a wide range of sequence perturbations, providing a baseline for future work in the field. We build a neural network model that predicts protein stability given only sequences of amino acids, and compare its performance to the assayed values. We also report another network model that is able to generate the amino acid sequences of novel stable proteins given requested secondary sequences. Finally, we show that the predictive model-despite weaknesses including a noisy data set-can be used to substantially increase the stability of both expert-designed and model-generated proteins.",

Furthermore, small structural variations in a single fold, sometimes only a few amino acids, can define a protein's molecular function. Hence, to design proteins with novel functionalities, such as molecular recognition, methods to control and sample shape diversity are necessary. To explore this space, we developed and experimentally validated a computational platform that can design a wide variety of small protein folds while sampling shape diversity. We designed and evaluated stability of about 30,000 de novo protein designs of eight different folds. Among these designs, about 6,200 stable proteins were identified, including some predicted to have a first-of-its-kind minimalized thioredoxin fold. Obtained data revealed protein folding rules\u00a0for structural features such as helix-connecting loops. Beyond serving as a resource for protein engineering, this massive and diverse dataset also provides training data for machine learning. We developed an accurate classifier to predict the stability of our designed proteins. The methods and the wide range of protein shapes provide a basis for designing new protein functions without compromising stability.",

        "abstract":"Although \u03b2-hairpins are widespread in proteins, there is no tool to coax any small peptide to adopt a \u03b2-hairpin conformation, regardless of sequence. Here, we report that \u03b4-linked \u03b3(R)-methyl-ornithine ( \u03b4  MeOrn) provides an improved \u03b2-turn template for inducing a \u03b2-hairpin conformation in peptides. We developed a synthesis of protected  \u03b4  MeOrn as a building block suitable for use in Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis. The synthesis begins with l-leucine and affords gram quantities of the N \u03b1  -Boc-N \u03b4  -Fmoc-\u03b3(R)-methyl-ornithine building block. X-ray crystallography confirms that the  \u03b4  MeOrn turn unit adopts a folded structure in a macrocyclic \u03b2-hairpin peptide. CD and NMR spectroscopy allow comparison of the  \u03b4  MeOrn turn template to the \u03b4-linked ornithine ( \u03b4  Orn) turn template that we previously introduced and to the popular d-Pro-Gly turn template. These studies show that the folding of the  \u03b4  MeOrn turn template is substantially better than that of  \u03b4  Orn and is comparable to d-Pro-Gly.",

        "abstract":"The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-binding integrins \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 are clinically validated cancer and fibrosis targets of considerable therapeutic importance. Compounds that can discriminate between homologous \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 and other RGD integrins, stabilize specific conformational states, and have high thermal stability could have considerable therapeutic utility. Existing small molecule and antibody inhibitors do not have all these properties, and hence\u00a0new approaches are needed. Here we describe a generalized method for computationally designing RGD-containing miniproteins selective for a single RGD integrin heterodimer and conformational state. We design hyperstable, selective \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 inhibitors that bind with picomolar affinity. CryoEM structures of the designed inhibitor-integrin complexes are very\u00a0close to the computational design models,\u00a0and\u00a0show\u00a0that the inhibitors stabilize specific conformational states of the\u00a0\u03b1v\u03b26 and the \u03b1v\u03b28 integrins. In a lung fibrosis mouse model, the \u03b1v\u03b26 inhibitor potently reduced fibrotic burden and improved overall lung mechanics, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of de novo designed integrin binding proteins with high selectivity.",

        "abstract":"The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-binding integrins \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 are clinically validated cancer and fibrosis targets of considerable therapeutic importance. Compounds that can discriminate between homologous \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 and other RGD integrins, stabilize specific conformational states, and have high thermal stability could have considerable therapeutic utility. Existing small molecule and antibody inhibitors do not have all these properties, and hence\u00a0new approaches are needed. Here we describe a generalized method for computationally designing RGD-containing miniproteins selective for a single RGD integrin heterodimer and conformational state. We design hyperstable, selective \u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 inhibitors that bind with picomolar affinity. CryoEM structures of the designed inhibitor-integrin complexes are very\u00a0close to the computational design models,\u00a0and\u00a0show\u00a0that the inhibitors stabilize specific conformational states of the\u00a0\u03b1v\u03b26 and the \u03b1v\u03b28 integrins. In a lung fibrosis mouse model, the \u03b1v\u03b26 inhibitor potently reduced fibrotic burden and improved overall lung mechanics, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of de novo designed integrin binding proteins with high selectivity.",

        "abstract":"Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a pattern recognition receptor critical for the innate immune response to intracellular pathogens, DNA damage, tumorigenesis and senescence. Binding to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) induces conformational changes in cGAS that activate the enzyme to produce 2'-3' cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a second messenger that initiates a potent interferon (IFN) response through its receptor, STING. Here, we combined two-state computational design with informatics-guided design to create constitutively active, dsDNA ligand-independent cGAS (CA-cGAS). We identified CA-cGAS mutants with IFN-stimulating activity approaching that of dsDNA-stimulated wild-type cGAS. DNA-independent adoption of the active conformation was directly confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In vivo expression of CA-cGAS in tumor cells resulted in STING-dependent tumor regression, demonstrating that the designed proteins have therapeutically relevant biological activity. Our work provides a general framework for stabilizing active conformations of enzymes and provides CA-cGAS variants that could be useful as genetically encoded adjuvants and tools for understanding inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract":"The design of proteins that bind to a specific site on the surface of a target protein using no information other than the three-dimensional structure of the target remains a challenge 1-5 . Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted design of binders to sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",

In place of hundreds of complex, membrane-bound G-protein coupled receptors, differential sensors employ arrays of small molecules. Here we show that arrays of computationally designed de novo peptides provide alternative synthetic receptors for differential sensing. We use self-assembling \u03b1-helical barrels (\u03b1HBs) with central channels that can be altered predictably to vary their sizes, shapes and chemistries. The channels accommodate environment-sensitive dyes that fluoresce upon binding. Challenging arrays of dye-loaded barrels with analytes causes differential fluorophore displacement. The resulting fluorimetric fingerprints are used to train machine-learning models that relate the patterns to the analytes. We show that this system discriminates between a range of biomolecules, drink, and diagnostically relevant biological samples. As \u03b1HBs are robust and chemically diverse, the system has potential to sense many analytes in various settings.",

        "abstract":"Protein therapeutics frequently face major challenges, including complicated production, instability, poor solubility, and aggregation. De novo protein design can readily address these challenges. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a topological refactoring strategy to design novel granulopoietic proteins starting from the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) structure. We change a protein fold by rearranging the sequence and optimising it towards the new fold. Testing four designs, we obtain two that possess nanomolar activity, the most active of which is highly thermostable and protease-resistant, and matches its designed structure to atomic accuracy. While the designs possess starkly different sequence and structure from the native G-CSF, they show specific activity in differentiating primary human haematopoietic stem cells into mature neutrophils. The designs also show significant and specific activity in vivo. Our topological refactoring approach is largely independent of sequence or structural context, and is therefore applicable to a wide range of protein targets.",

In this work, we explore the effects on structure and stability of an introduced salt bridge cluster in the context of three different de novo TIM barrels.

        "abstract":"While the application of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to helical polymers in biology has a long history, due to the huge number of helical macromolecular assemblies in viruses, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, the use of cryo-EM to study synthetic soft matter noncovalent polymers has been much more limited. This has mainly been due to the lack of familiarity with cryo-EM in the materials science and chemistry communities, in contrast to the fact that cryo-EM was developed as a biological technique. Nevertheless, the relatively few structures of self-assembled peptide nanotubes and ribbons solved at near-atomic resolution by cryo-EM have demonstrated that cryo-EM should be the method of choice for a structural analysis of synthetic helical filaments. In addition, cryo-EM has also demonstrated that the self-assembly of soft matter polymers has enormous potential for polymorphism, something that may be obscured by techniques such as scattering and spectroscopy. These cryo-EM structures have revealed how far we currently are from being able to predict the structure of these polymers due to their chaotic self-assembly behavior.",

        "abstract":"The design of proteins that bind to a specific site on the surface of a target protein using no information other than the three-dimensional structure of the target remains a challenge 1-5 . Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted design of binders to sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",

        "abstract":"The task of protein sequence design is central to nearly all rational protein engineering problems, and enormous effort has gone into the development of energy functions to guide design. Here, we investigate the capability of a deep neural network model to automate design of sequences onto protein backbones, having learned directly from crystal structure data and without any human-specified priors. The model generalizes to native topologies not seen during training, producing experimentally stable designs. We evaluate the generalizability of our method to a de novo TIM-barrel scaffold. The model produces novel sequences, and high-resolution crystal structures of two designs show excellent agreement with in silico models. Our findings demonstrate the tractability of an entirely learned method for protein sequence design.",

        "abstract":"Understanding protein folding is crucial for protein sciences. The conformational spaces and energy landscapes of cold (unfolded) protein states, as well as the associated transitions, are hardly explored. Furthermore, it is not known how structure relates to the cooperativity of cold transitions, if cold and heat unfolded states are thermodynamically similar, and if cold states play important roles for protein function. We created the cold unfolding 4-helix bundle DCUB1 with a de novo designed bipartite hydrophilic\/hydrophobic core featuring a hydrogen bond network which extends across the bundle in order to study the relative importance of hydrophobic versus hydrophilic protein-water interactions for cold unfolding. Structural and thermodynamic characterization resulted in the discovery of a complex energy landscape for cold transitions, while the heat unfolded state is a random coil. Below \u223c0 \u00b0C, the core of DCUB1 disintegrates in a largely cooperative manner, while a near-native helical content is retained. The resulting cold core-unfolded state is compact and features extensive internal dynamics. Below -5 \u00b0C, two additional cold transitions are seen, that is, (i) the formation of a water-mediated, compact, and highly dynamic dimer, and (ii) the onset of cold helix unfolding decoupled from cold core unfolding. Our results suggest that cold unfolding is initiated by the intrusion of water into the hydrophilic core network and that cooperativity can be tuned by varying the number of core hydrogen bond networks. Protein design has proven to be invaluable to explore the energy landscapes of cold states and to robustly test related theories.",

However, designing peptide-binding proteins is challenging, as most peptides do not have defined structures in isolation, and hydrogen bonds must be made to the buried polar groups in the peptide backbone 1-3 . Here, inspired by natural and re-engineered protein-peptide systems 4-11 , we set out to design proteins made out of repeating units that bind peptides with repeating sequences, with a one-to-one correspondence between the repeat units of the protein and those of the peptide. We use geometric hashing to identify protein backbones and peptide-docking arrangements that are compatible with bidentate hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the protein and the peptide backbone 12 . The remainder of the protein sequence is then optimized for folding and peptide binding. We design repeat proteins to bind to six different tripeptide-repeat sequences in polyproline II conformations. The proteins are hyperstable and bind to four to six tandem repeats of their tripeptide targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities in vitro and in living cells. Crystal structures reveal repeating interactions between protein and peptide interactions as designed, including ladders of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains to peptide backbones. By redesigning the binding interfaces of individual repeat units, specificity can be achieved for non-repeating peptide sequences and for disordered regions of native proteins.",

        "abstract":"The ability to finely control the structure of protein folds is an important prerequisite to functional protein design. The TIM barrel fold is an important target for these efforts as it is highly enriched for diverse functions in nature. Although a TIM barrel protein has been designed de novo, the ability to finely alter the curvature of the central beta barrel and the overall architecture of the fold remains elusive, limiting its utility for functional design. Here, we report the de novo design of a TIM barrel with ovoid (twofold) symmetry, drawing inspiration from natural beta and TIM barrels with ovoid curvature. We use an autoregressive backbone sampling strategy to implement our hypothesis for elongated barrel curvature, followed by an iterative enrichment sequence design protocol to obtain sequences which yield a high proportion of successfully folding designs. Designed sequences are highly stable and fold to the designed barrel curvature as determined by a 2.1\u2009\u00c5 resolution crystal structure. The designs show robustness to drastic mutations, retaining high melting temperatures even when multiple charged residues are buried in the hydrophobic core or when the hydrophobic core is ablated to alanine. As a scaffold with a greater capacity for hosting diverse hydrogen bonding networks and installation of binding pockets or active sites, the ovoid TIM barrel represents a major step towards the de novo design of functional TIM barrels.",

We obtained ten designs for which all three chains cooperatively assembled into heterotrimers with few or no other species present.

        "abstract":"The de novo design of three protein chains that associate to form a heterotrimer (but not any of the possible two-chain heterodimers) and that can drive the assembly of higher-order branching structures is an important challenge for protein design. We designed helical heterotrimers with specificity conferred by buried hydrogen bond networks and large aromatic residues to enhance shape complementary packing. We obtained ten designs for which all three chains cooperatively assembled into heterotrimers with few or no other species present. Crystal structures of a helical bundle heterotrimer and extended versions, with helical repeat proteins fused to individual subunits, showed all three chains assembling in the designed orientation. We used these heterotrimers as building blocks to construct larger cyclic oligomers, which were structurally validated by electron microscopy. Our three-way junction designs provide new routes to complex protein nanostructures and enable the scaffolding of three distinct ligands for modulation of cell signaling.",

However, there are considerable challenges to designing such structures, and there has been little success thus far. Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta energy-based methods and deep learning approaches to design four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and oligonucleotide\/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful designs with high thermal stability and experimentally determined structures with less than 2.4 \u00c5 rmsd from the designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone. The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape space available for designing binders to protein targets of interest.",

        "abstract":"Small beta barrel proteins are attractive targets for computational design because of their considerable functional diversity despite their very small size (<70 amino acids). However, there are considerable challenges to designing such structures, and there has been little success thus far. Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta energy-based methods and deep learning approaches to design four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and oligonucleotide\/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful designs with high thermal stability and experimentally determined structures with less than 2.4 \u00c5 rmsd from the designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone. The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape space available for designing binders to protein targets of interest.",

We designed 184 6-12 residue macrocycles with a wide range of predicted structures containing noncanonical backbone modifications and experimentally determined structures of 35; 29 are very close to the computational models. With such control, we show that membrane permeability can be systematically achieved by ensuring all amide (NH) groups are engaged in internal hydrogen bonding interactions. 84 designs over the 6-12 residue size range cross membranes with an apparent permeability greater than 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 -6  cm\/s. Designs with exposed NH groups can be\u00a0made membrane permeable through the design of an alternative isoenergetic fully hydrogen-bonded state favored in the lipid membrane. The ability to robustly design membrane-permeable and orally bioavailable peptides\u00a0with high structural accuracy should contribute to the next generation of designed macrocycle therapeutics.",

        "abstract":"Protein nanocages are of increasing interest for use as drug capsules, but the encapsulation and release of drug molecules at appropriate times require the reversible association and dissociation of the nanocages. One promising approach to addressing this challenge is the design of metal-dependent associating proteins. Such designed proteins typically have Cys or His residues at the protein surface for connecting the associating proteins through metal-ion coordination. However, Cys and His residues favor interactions with soft and borderline metal ions, such as Au +  and Zn 2+ , classified by the hard and soft acids and bases concept, restricting the types of metal ions available to drive association. Here, we show the alkaline earth (AE) metal-dependent association of the recently designed artificial protein nanocage TIP60, which is composed of 60-mer fusion proteins. The introduction of a Glu (hard base) mutation to the fusion protein (K67E mutant) prevented the formation of the 60-mer but formed the expected cage structure in the presence of Ca, Sr, or Ba ions (hard acids). Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis indicated a Ba ion at the interface of the subunits. Furthermore, we demonstrated the encapsulation and release of single-stranded DNA molecules using this system. Our results provide insights into the design of AE metal-dependent association and dissociation mechanisms for proteins.",

        "abstract":"Differential sensing attempts to mimic the mammalian senses of smell and taste to identify analytes and complex mixtures. In place of hundreds of complex, membrane-bound G-protein coupled receptors, differential sensors employ arrays of small molecules. Here we show that arrays of computationally designed de novo peptides provide alternative synthetic receptors for differential sensing. We use self-assembling \u03b1-helical barrels (\u03b1HBs) with central channels that can be altered predictably to vary their sizes, shapes and chemistries. The channels accommodate environment-sensitive dyes that fluoresce upon binding. Challenging arrays of dye-loaded barrels with analytes causes differential fluorophore displacement. The resulting fluorimetric fingerprints are used to train machine-learning models that relate the patterns to the analytes. We show that this system discriminates between a range of biomolecules, drink, and diagnostically relevant biological samples. As \u03b1HBs are robust and chemically diverse, the system has potential to sense many analytes in various settings.",

        "abstract":"The design of completely synthetic proteins from first principles- de novo  protein design-is challenging. This is because, despite recent advances in computational protein-structure prediction and design, we do not understand fully the sequence-to-structure relationships for protein folding, assembly, and stabilization. Antiparallel 4-helix bundles are amongst the most studied scaffolds for  de novo  protein design. We set out to re-examine this target, and to determine clear sequence-to-structure relationships, or design rules, for the structure. Our aim was to determine a common and robust sequence background for designing multiple  de novo  4-helix bundles. In turn, this could be used in chemical and synthetic biology to direct protein-protein interactions and as scaffolds for functional protein design. Our approach starts by analyzing known antiparallel 4-helix coiled-coil structures to deduce design rules. In terms of the heptad repeat,   abcdefg   - i.e. , the sequence signature of many helical bundles-the key features that we identify are:   a   = Leu,   d   = Ile,   e   = Ala,   g   = Gln, and the use of complementary charged residues at b and c. Next, we implement these rules in the rational design of synthetic peptides to form antiparallel homo- and heterotetramers. Finally, we use the sequence of the homotetramer to derive in one step a single-chain 4-helix-bundle protein for recombinant production in  E. coli . All of the assembled designs are confirmed in aqueous solution using biophysical methods, and ultimately by determining high-resolution X-ray crystal structures. Our route from peptides to proteins provides an understanding of the role of each residue in each design.",

Here we explore the customization of the backbone and sequence of a de novo designed eight stranded \u03b2-barrel protein to create catalysts for a retro-aldolase model reaction. We show that active and specific catalysts can be designed in this fold and use directed evolution to further optimize activity and stereoselectivity. Our results support previous suggestions that different folds have different inherent amenability to evolution and this property could account, in part, for the distribution of natural enzymes among different folds.",

        "abstract":"Antibody derivatives have sought to recapitulate the antigen binding properties of antibodies, but with improved biophysical attributes convenient for therapeutic, diagnostic and research applications. However, their success has been limited by the naturally occurring structure of the immunoglobulin dimer displaying hypervariable binding loops, which is hard to modify by traditional engineering approaches. Here, we devise geometrical principles for de novo designing single-chain immunoglobulin dimers, as a tunable two-domain architecture that optimizes biophysical properties through more favorable dimer interfaces. Guided by these principles, we computationally designed protein scaffolds that were hyperstable, structurally accurate and robust for accommodating multiple functional loops, both individually and in combination, as confirmed through biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography. We showcase the modularity of this architecture by deep-learning-based diversification, opening up the possibility for tailoring the number, positioning, and relative orientation of ligand-binding loops targeting one or two distal epitopes. Our results provide a route to custom-design robust protein scaffolds for harboring multiple functional loops.",

Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

        "abstract":"Protein crystallization plays a central role in structural biology. Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

We designed 184 6-12 residue macrocycles with a wide range of predicted structures containing noncanonical backbone modifications and experimentally determined structures of 35; 29 are very close to the computational models. With such control, we show that membrane permeability can be systematically achieved by ensuring all amide (NH) groups are engaged in internal hydrogen bonding interactions. 84 designs over the 6-12 residue size range cross membranes with an apparent permeability greater than 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 -6  cm\/s. Designs with exposed NH groups can be\u00a0made membrane permeable through the design of an alternative isoenergetic fully hydrogen-bonded state favored in the lipid membrane. The ability to robustly design membrane-permeable and orally bioavailable peptides\u00a0with high structural accuracy should contribute to the next generation of designed macrocycle therapeutics.",

Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

        "abstract":"Protein crystallization plays a central role in structural biology. Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

Here, we describe a deep learning-based protein sequence design method, ProteinMPNN, that has outstanding performance in both in silico and experimental tests. On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4% compared with 32.9% for Rosetta. The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges. We demonstrate the broad utility and high accuracy of ProteinMPNN using x-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and functional studies by rescuing previously failed designs, which were made using Rosetta or AlphaFold, of protein monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, tetrahedral nanoparticles, and target-binding proteins.",

Crystal structures of seven designs are very similar to the computational models (median root mean square deviation: 0.6 angstroms), as are three cryo-electron microscopy structures of giant 10-nanometer rings with up to 1550 residues and  C  33  symmetry; all differ considerably from previously solved structures.

        "abstract":"Mimics of protein secondary and tertiary structure offer rationally-designed inhibitors of biomolecular interactions. \u03b2-Sheet mimics have a storied history in bioorganic chemistry and are typically designed with synthetic or natural turn segments. We hypothesized that replacement of terminal inter-\u03b2-strand hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) may lead to conformationally-defined macrocyclic \u03b2-sheets without the requirement for natural or synthetic \u03b2-turns, thereby providing a minimal mimic of a protein \u03b2-sheet. To access turn-less antiparallel \u03b2-sheet mimics, we developed a facile solid phase synthesis protocol. We surveyed a dataset of protein \u03b2-sheets for naturally observed interstrand side chain interactions. This bioinformatics survey highlighted an over-abundance of aromatic-aromatic, cation-\u03c0 and ionic interactions in \u03b2-sheets. In correspondence with natural \u03b2-sheets, we find that minimal HBS mimics show robust \u03b2-sheet formation when specific amino acid residue pairings are incorporated. In isolated \u03b2-sheets, aromatic interactions endow superior conformational stability over ionic or cation-\u03c0 interactions. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopies, along with high-resolution X-ray crystallography, support our design principles.",

Here, we describe deep learning approaches for scaffolding such functional sites without needing to prespecify the fold or secondary structure of the scaffold. The first approach, \"constrained hallucination,\" optimizes sequences such that their predicted structures contain the desired functional site. The second approach, \"inpainting,\" starts from the functional site and fills in additional sequence and structure to create a viable protein scaffold in a single forward pass through a specifically trained RoseTTAFold network. We use these two methods to design candidate immunogens, receptor traps, metalloproteins, enzymes, and protein-binding proteins and validate the designs using a combination of in silico and experimental tests.",

Although there is great interest in harnessing this cytokine as a therapeutic in natural or engineered formats, the clinical potential of native IL-4 is limited by its instability and pleiotropic actions. Here, we design IL-4 cytokine mimetics (denoted Neo-4) based on a de novo engineered IL-2 mimetic scaffold and demonstrate that these cytokines can recapitulate physiological functions of IL-4 in cellular and animal models. In contrast with natural IL-4, Neo-4 is hyperstable and signals exclusively through the type I IL-4 receptor complex, providing previously inaccessible insights into differential IL-4 signaling through type I versus type II receptors. Because of their hyperstability, our computationally designed mimetics can directly incorporate into sophisticated biomaterials that require heat processing, such as three-dimensional-printed scaffolds. Neo-4 should be broadly useful for interrogating IL-4 biology, and the design workflow will inform targeted cytokine therapeutic development.",

        "abstract":"A challenge for design of protein-small-molecule recognition is that incorporation of cavities with size, shape, and composition suitable for specific recognition can considerably destabilize protein monomers. This challenge can be overcome through binding pockets formed at homo-oligomeric interfaces between folded monomers. Interfaces surrounding the central homo-oligomer symmetry axes necessarily have the same symmetry and so may not be well suited to binding asymmetric molecules. To enable general recognition of arbitrary asymmetric substrates and small molecules, we developed an approach to designing asymmetric interfaces at off-axis sites on homo-oligomers, analogous to those found in native homo-oligomeric proteins such as glutamine synthetase. We symmetrically dock curved helical repeat proteins such that they form pockets at the asymmetric interface of the oligomer with sizes ranging from several angstroms, appropriate for binding a single ion, to up to more than 20 \u00c5 across. Of the 133 proteins tested, 84 had soluble expression in  E. coli , 47 had correct oligomeric states in solution, 35 had small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data largely consistent with design models, and 8 had negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) 2D class averages showing the structures coming together as designed. Both an X-ray crystal structure and a cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure are close to the computational design models. The nature of these proteins as homo-oligomers allows them to be readily built into higher-order structures such as nanocages, and the asymmetric pockets of these structures open rich possibilities for small-molecule binder design free from the constraints associated with monomer destabilization.",

        "abstract":"A challenge for design of protein-small-molecule recognition is that incorporation of cavities with size, shape, and composition suitable for specific recognition can considerably destabilize protein monomers. This challenge can be overcome through binding pockets formed at homo-oligomeric interfaces between folded monomers. Interfaces surrounding the central homo-oligomer symmetry axes necessarily have the same symmetry and so may not be well suited to binding asymmetric molecules. To enable general recognition of arbitrary asymmetric substrates and small molecules, we developed an approach to designing asymmetric interfaces at off-axis sites on homo-oligomers, analogous to those found in native homo-oligomeric proteins such as glutamine synthetase. We symmetrically dock curved helical repeat proteins such that they form pockets at the asymmetric interface of the oligomer with sizes ranging from several angstroms, appropriate for binding a single ion, to up to more than 20 \u00c5 across. Of the 133 proteins tested, 84 had soluble expression in  E. coli , 47 had correct oligomeric states in solution, 35 had small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data largely consistent with design models, and 8 had negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) 2D class averages showing the structures coming together as designed. Both an X-ray crystal structure and a cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure are close to the computational design models. The nature of these proteins as homo-oligomers allows them to be readily built into higher-order structures such as nanocages, and the asymmetric pockets of these structures open rich possibilities for small-molecule binder design free from the constraints associated with monomer destabilization.",

        "abstract":"The assembly of the \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) to form oligomers and fibrils is closely associated with the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease. A\u03b2 is a shape-shifting peptide capable of adopting many conformations and folds within the multitude of oligomers and fibrils the peptide forms. These properties have precluded detailed structural elucidation and biological characterization of homogeneous, well-defined A\u03b2 oligomers. In this paper, we compare the structural, biophysical, and biological characteristics of two different covalently stabilized isomorphic trimers derived from the central and  C -terminal regions A\u03b2. X-ray crystallography reveals the structures of the trimers and shows that each trimer forms a ball-shaped dodecamer. Solution-phase and cell-based studies demonstrate that the two trimers exhibit markedly different assembly and biological properties. One trimer forms small soluble oligomers that enter cells through endocytosis and activate capase-3\/7-mediated apoptosis, while the other trimer forms large insoluble aggregates that accumulate on the outer plasma membrane and elicit cellular toxicity through an apoptosis-independent mechanism. The two trimers also exhibit different effects on the aggregation, toxicity, and cellular interaction of full-length A\u03b2, with one trimer showing a greater propensity to interact with A\u03b2 than the other. The studies described in this paper indicate that the two trimers share structural, biophysical, and biological characteristics with oligomers of full-length A\u03b2. The varying structural, assembly, and biological characteristics of the two trimers provide a working model for how different A\u03b2 trimers can assemble and lead to different biological effects, which may help shed light on the differences among A\u03b2 oligomers.",

        "abstract":"Attaining molecular-level control over solidification processes is a crucial aspect of materials science. To control ice formation, organisms have evolved bewildering arrays of ice-binding proteins (IBPs), but these have poorly understood structure-activity relationships. We propose that reverse engineering using de novo computational protein design can shed light on structure-activity relationships of IBPs. We hypothesized that the model alpha-helical winter flounder antifreeze protein uses an unusual undertwisting of its alpha-helix to align its putative ice-binding threonine residues in exactly the same direction. We test this hypothesis by designing a series of straight three-helix bundles with an ice-binding helix projecting threonines and two supporting helices constraining the twist of the ice-binding helix. Our findings show that ice-recrystallization inhibition by the designed proteins increases with the degree of designed undertwisting, thus validating our hypothesis, and opening up avenues for the computational design of IBPs.",

Among proteins, alpha-helical coiled coils have such symmetric, extendable architectures, but are limited by the relatively fixed geometry and flexibility of the helical protomers. Here we describe a systematic approach to generating modular and rigid repeat protein oligomers with coincident C 2  to C 8  and superhelical symmetry axes that can be readily extended by repeat propagation. From these building blocks, we demonstrate that a wide range of unbounded fibres can be systematically designed by introducing hydrophilic surface patches that force staggering of the monomers; the geometry of such fibres can be precisely tuned by varying the number of repeat units in the monomer and the placement of the hydrophilic patches.",

        "abstract":"De novo protein design methods can create proteins with folds not yet seen in nature. These methods largely focus on optimizing the compatibility between the designed sequence and the intended conformation, without explicit consideration of protein folding pathways. Deeply knotted proteins, whose topologies may introduce substantial barriers to folding, thus represent an interesting test case for protein design. Here we report our attempts to design proteins with trefoil (3 1 ) and pentafoil (5 1 ) knotted topologies. We extended previously described algorithms for tandem repeat protein design in order to construct deeply knotted backbones and matching designed repeat sequences (N\u2009=\u20093 repeats for the trefoil and N\u2009=\u20095 for the pentafoil). We confirmed the intended conformation for the trefoil design by X ray crystallography, and we report here on this protein's structure, stability, and folding behaviour. The pentafoil design misfolded into an asymmetric structure (despite a 5-fold symmetric sequence); two of the four repeat-repeat units matched the designed backbone while the other two diverged to form local contacts, leading to a trefoil rather than pentafoil knotted topology. Our results also provide insights into the folding of knotted proteins.",

We describe a \"top-down\" reinforcement learning-based design approach that solves this problem using Monte Carlo tree search to sample protein conformers in the context of an overall architecture and specified functional constraints. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the designed disk-shaped nanopores and ultracompact icosahedra are very close to the computational models. The icosohedra enable very-high-density display of immunogens and signaling molecules, which potentiates vaccine response and angiogenesis induction. Our approach enables the top-down design of complex protein nanomaterials with desired system properties and demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning in protein design.",

        "abstract":"Protein crystallization plays a central role in structural biology. Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

        "abstract":"Computationally designed protein nanoparticles have recently emerged as a promising platform for the development of new vaccines and biologics. For many applications, secretion of designed nanoparticles from eukaryotic cells would be advantageous, but in practice, they often secrete poorly. Here we show that designed hydrophobic interfaces that drive nanoparticle assembly are often predicted to form cryptic transmembrane domains, suggesting that interaction with the membrane insertion machinery could limit efficient secretion. We develop a general computational protocol, the Degreaser, to design away cryptic transmembrane domains without sacrificing protein stability. The retroactive application of the Degreaser to previously designed nanoparticle components and nanoparticles considerably improves secretion, and modular integration of the Degreaser into design pipelines results in new nanoparticles that secrete as robustly as naturally occurring protein assemblies. Both the Degreaser protocol and the nanoparticles we describe may be broadly useful in biotechnological applications.",

        "abstract":"Computationally designed protein nanoparticles have recently emerged as a promising platform for the development of new vaccines and biologics. For many applications, secretion of designed nanoparticles from eukaryotic cells would be advantageous, but in practice, they often secrete poorly. Here we show that designed hydrophobic interfaces that drive nanoparticle assembly are often predicted to form cryptic transmembrane domains, suggesting that interaction with the membrane insertion machinery could limit efficient secretion. We develop a general computational protocol, the Degreaser, to design away cryptic transmembrane domains without sacrificing protein stability. The retroactive application of the Degreaser to previously designed nanoparticle components and nanoparticles considerably improves secretion, and modular integration of the Degreaser into design pipelines results in new nanoparticles that secrete as robustly as naturally occurring protein assemblies. Both the Degreaser protocol and the nanoparticles we describe may be broadly useful in biotechnological applications.",

We describe a general approach to bind such segments in \u03b2-strand and \u03b2-hairpin conformations using de novo designed scaffolds that contain deep peptide-binding clefts. The designs bind their cognate peptides in vitro with nanomolar affinities. The crystal structure of a designed protein-peptide complex is close to the design model, and NMR characterization reveals how the peptide-binding cleft is protected in the apo state. We use the approach to design binders to the amyloid-forming proteins transthyretin, tau, serum amyloid A1 and amyloid \u03b2 1-42  (A\u03b242). The A\u03b2 binders block the assembly of A\u03b2 fibrils as effectively as the most potent of the clinically tested antibodies to date and protect cells from toxic A\u03b242 species.",

Here we describe the design of \"hinge\" proteins that populate one designed state in the absence of ligand and a second designed state in the presence of ligand.

Here we describe the design of \"hinge\" proteins that populate one designed state in the absence of ligand and a second designed state in the presence of ligand. X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and binding measurements demonstrate that despite the significant structural differences the two states are designed with atomic level accuracy and that the conformational and binding equilibria are closely coupled.",

Designing proteins with two distinct but fully structured conformations is a challenge for protein design as it requires sculpting an energy landscape with two distinct minima. Here we describe the design of \"hinge\" proteins that populate one designed state in the absence of ligand and a second designed state in the presence of ligand. X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and binding measurements demonstrate that despite the significant structural differences the two states are designed with atomic level accuracy and that the conformational and binding equilibria are closely coupled.",

One of the major routes to such materials is rigid body sequence-independent docking of cyclic oligomers into architectures with point group or lattice symmetries. Current methods for docking and designing such assemblies are tailored to specific classes of symmetry and are difficult to modify for novel applications. Here we describe RPXDock, a fast, flexible, and modular software package for sequence-independent rigid-body protein docking across a wide range of symmetric architectures that is easily customizable for further development. RPXDock uses an efficient hierarchical search and a residue-pair transform (RPX) scoring method to rapidly search through multidimensional docking space. We describe the structure of the software, provide practical guidelines for its use, and describe the available functionalities including a variety of score functions and filtering tools that can be used to guide and refine docking results towards desired configurations.",

Among proteins, alpha-helical coiled coils have such symmetric, extendable architectures, but are limited by the relatively fixed geometry and flexibility of the helical protomers. Here we describe a systematic approach to generating modular and rigid repeat protein oligomers with coincident C 2  to C 8  and superhelical symmetry axes that can be readily extended by repeat propagation. From these building blocks, we demonstrate that a wide range of unbounded fibres can be systematically designed by introducing hydrophilic surface patches that force staggering of the monomers; the geometry of such fibres can be precisely tuned by varying the number of repeat units in the monomer and the placement of the hydrophilic patches.",

        "abstract":"A wooden house frame consists of many different lumber pieces, but because of the regularity of these building blocks, the structure can be designed using straightforward geometrical principles. The design of multicomponent protein assemblies, in comparison, has been much more complex, largely owing to the irregular shapes of protein structures 1 . Here we describe extendable linear, curved and angled protein building blocks, as well as inter-block interactions, that conform to specified geometric standards; assemblies designed using these blocks inherit their extendability and regular interaction surfaces, enabling them to be expanded or contracted by varying the number of modules, and reinforced with secondary struts. Using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, we validate nanomaterial designs ranging from simple polygonal and circular oligomers that can be concentrically nested, up to large polyhedral nanocages and unbounded straight 'train track' assemblies with reconfigurable sizes and geometries that can be readily blueprinted.\u00a0Because of the complexity of protein structures and sequence-structure relationships, it has not previously been possible to build up large protein assemblies by deliberate placement of protein backbones onto a blank three-dimensional canvas; the simplicity and geometric regularity of our design platform now enables construction of protein nanomaterials according to 'back of an envelope' architectural blueprints.",

        "abstract":"Though thiols are exceptionally versatile, their high reactivity has also hindered the synthesis and characterization of well-defined thiol-containing porous materials. Leveraging the mild conditions of the noncovalent peptide assembly, we readily synthesized and characterized a number of frameworks with thiols displayed at many unique positions and in several permutations. Importantly, nearly all assemblies were structurally determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction to reveal their rich sequence-structure landscape and the cooperative noncovalent interactions underlying their assembly. These observations and supporting molecular dynamics calculations enabled rational engineering by the positive and negative design of noncovalent interactions. Furthermore, the thiol-containing frameworks undergo diverse single-crystal-to-single-crystal reactions, including toxic metal ion coordination (e.g., Cd 2+ , Pb 2+ , and Hg 2+ ), selective uptake of Hg 2+  ions, and redox transformations. Notably, we find a framework that supports thiol-nitrosothiol interconversion, which is applicable for biocompatible nitric oxide delivery. The modularity, ease of synthesis, functionality, and well-defined nature of these peptide-based thiol frameworks are expected to accelerate the design of complex materials with reactive active sites.",

        "abstract":"Though thiols are exceptionally versatile, their high reactivity has also hindered the synthesis and characterization of well-defined thiol-containing porous materials. Leveraging the mild conditions of the noncovalent peptide assembly, we readily synthesized and characterized a number of frameworks with thiols displayed at many unique positions and in several permutations. Importantly, nearly all assemblies were structurally determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction to reveal their rich sequence-structure landscape and the cooperative noncovalent interactions underlying their assembly. These observations and supporting molecular dynamics calculations enabled rational engineering by the positive and negative design of noncovalent interactions. Furthermore, the thiol-containing frameworks undergo diverse single-crystal-to-single-crystal reactions, including toxic metal ion coordination (e.g., Cd 2+ , Pb 2+ , and Hg 2+ ), selective uptake of Hg 2+  ions, and redox transformations. Notably, we find a framework that supports thiol-nitrosothiol interconversion, which is applicable for biocompatible nitric oxide delivery. The modularity, ease of synthesis, functionality, and well-defined nature of these peptide-based thiol frameworks are expected to accelerate the design of complex materials with reactive active sites.",

        "abstract":"Targeted intracellular delivery via receptor-mediated endocytosis requires the delivered cargo to escape the endosome to prevent lysosomal degradation. This can in principle be achieved by membrane lysis tightly restricted to endosomal membranes upon internalization to avoid general membrane insertion and lysis. Here, we describe the design of small monomeric proteins with buried histidine containing pH-responsive hydrogen bond networks and membrane permeating amphipathic helices. Of the 30 designs that were experimentally tested, all expressed in Escherichia coli, 13 were monomeric with the expected secondary structure, and 4 designs disrupted artificial liposomes in a pH-dependent manner. Mutational analysis showed that the buried histidine hydrogen bond networks mediate pH-responsiveness and control lysis of model membranes within a very narrow range of pH (6.0-5.5) with almost no lysis occurring at neutral pH. These tightly controlled lytic monomers could help mediate endosomal escape in designed targeted delivery platforms.",

Previously, we reported Syn-F4, the first de novo protein that meets both criteria. Syn-F4 hydrolyzed the siderophore ferric enterobactin, and expression of Syn-F4 allowed an inviable strain of  Escherichia coli  (\u0394 fes ) to grow in iron-limited medium. Here, we describe the crystal structure of Syn-F4. Syn-F4 forms a dimeric 4-helix bundle. Each monomer comprises two long \u03b1-helices, and the loops of the Syn-F4 dimer are on the same end of the bundle ( syn  topology). Interestingly, there is a penetrated hole in the central region of the Syn-F4 structure. Extensive mutagenesis experiments in a previous study showed that five residues (Glu26, His74, Arg77, Lys78, and Arg85) were essential for enzymatic activity in vivo. All these residues are located around the hole in the central region of the Syn-F4 structure, suggesting a putative active site with a catalytic dyad (Glu26-His74). The complete inactivity of purified proteins with mutations at the five residues supports the putative active site and reaction mechanism. Molecular dynamics and docking simulations of the ferric enterobactin siderophore binding to the Syn-F4 structure demonstrate the dynamic property of the putative active site. The structure and active site of Syn-F4 are completely different from native enterobactin esterase enzymes, thereby demonstrating that proteins designed de novo can provide life-sustaining catalytic activities using structures and mechanisms dramatically different from those that arose in nature.",

        "abstract":"The design of small-molecule-binding proteins requires protein backbones that contain cavities. Previous design efforts were based on naturally occurring cavity-containing backbone architectures. Here, we designed diverse cavity-containing backbones without predefined architectures by introducing tailored restraints into the backbone sampling driven by SCUBA (Side Chain-Unknown Backbone Arrangement), a neural network statistical energy function. For 521 out of 5816 designs, the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the C\u03b1 atoms for the AlphaFold2-predicted structures and our designed structures are within 2.0\u00a0\u00c5. We experimentally tested 10 designed proteins and determined the crystal structures of two of them. One closely agrees with the designed model, while the other forms a domain-swapped dimer, where the partial structures are in agreement with the designed structures. Our results indicate that data-driven methods such as SCUBA hold great potential for designing de novo proteins with tailored small-molecule-binding function.",

        "abstract":"The design of small-molecule-binding proteins requires protein backbones that contain cavities. Previous design efforts were based on naturally occurring cavity-containing backbone architectures. Here, we designed diverse cavity-containing backbones without predefined architectures by introducing tailored restraints into the backbone sampling driven by SCUBA (Side Chain-Unknown Backbone Arrangement), a neural network statistical energy function. For 521 out of 5816 designs, the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the C\u03b1 atoms for the AlphaFold2-predicted structures and our designed structures are within 2.0\u00a0\u00c5. We experimentally tested 10 designed proteins and determined the crystal structures of two of them. One closely agrees with the designed model, while the other forms a domain-swapped dimer, where the partial structures are in agreement with the designed structures. Our results indicate that data-driven methods such as SCUBA hold great potential for designing de novo proteins with tailored small-molecule-binding function.",

        "abstract":"An increasing number of protein interaction domains and their targets are being found to be intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The corresponding target recognition mechanisms are mostly elusive because of challenges in performing detailed structural analysis of highly dynamic IDP-IDP complexes. Here, we show that by combining recently developed computational approaches with experiments, the structure of the complex between the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of protein 4.1G and its target IDP region in NuMA can be dissected at high resolution. First, we carry out systematic mutational scanning using dihydrofolate reductase-based protein complementarity analysis to identify essential interaction regions and key residues. The results are found to be highly consistent with an \u03b1\/\u03b2-type complex structure predicted by AlphaFold2 (AF2). We then design mutants based on the predicted structure using a deep learning protein sequence design method. The solved crystal structure of one mutant presents the same core structure as predicted by AF2. Further computational prediction and experimental assessment indicate that the well-defined core structure is conserved across complexes of 4.1G CTD with other potential targets. Thus, we reveal that an intrinsically disordered protein interaction domain uses an \u03b1\/\u03b2-type structure module formed through synergistic folding to recognize broad IDP targets. Moreover, we show that computational prediction and experiment can be jointly applied to segregate true IDP regions from the core structural domains of IDP-IDP complexes and to uncover the structure-dependent mechanisms of some otherwise elusive IDP-IDP interactions.",

While the CCPO strategy has proven successful in designing diverse protein topologies, no high-resolution structural information has been available about these novel protein folds. Here we report the crystal structure of a single-chain CCPO in the shape of a triangle. While neither cyclization nor the addition of nanobodies enabled crystallization, it was ultimately facilitated by the inclusion of a GCN 2  homodimer. Triangle edges are formed by the orthogonal parallel coiled-coil dimers P1:P2, P3:P4, and GCN 2  connected by short linkers. A triangle has a large central cavity and is additionally stabilized by side-chain interactions between neighboring segments at each vertex. The crystal lattice is densely packed and stabilized by a large number of contacts between triangles. Interestingly, the polypeptide chain folds into a trefoil-type protein knot topology, and AlphaFold2 fails to predict the correct fold. The structure validates the modular CC-based protein design strategy, providing molecular insight underlying CCPO stabilization and new opportunities for the design.",

        "abstract":"Protein crystallization plays a central role in structural biology. Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain-side-chain interactions across protein-protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100\u2009\u00b5m three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.",

Most existing models for de novo peptide design are largely based on sequence homology that can be restricted based on evolutionarily derived protein sequences and lack the physicochemical context essential in protein folding.

In this study, we created and tested a custom peptide generative adversarial network intended to design peptide sequences that can fold into the \u03b2-hairpin secondary structure.

The beta generative adversarial network model robustly distinguishes secondary structures of \u03b2 hairpin from \u03b1 helix and intrinsically disordered peptides with an accuracy of up to 96% and generates artificial \u03b2-hairpin peptide sequences with minimum sequence identities around 31% and 50% when compared against the current NCBI PDB and nonredundant databases, respectively.

        "abstract":"A wooden house frame consists of many different lumber pieces, but because of the regularity of these building blocks, the structure can be designed using straightforward geometrical principles. The design of multicomponent protein assemblies, in comparison, has been much more complex, largely owing to the irregular shapes of protein structures 1 . Here we describe extendable linear, curved and angled protein building blocks, as well as inter-block interactions, that conform to specified geometric standards; assemblies designed using these blocks inherit their extendability and regular interaction surfaces, enabling them to be expanded or contracted by varying the number of modules, and reinforced with secondary struts. Using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, we validate nanomaterial designs ranging from simple polygonal and circular oligomers that can be concentrically nested, up to large polyhedral nanocages and unbounded straight 'train track' assemblies with reconfigurable sizes and geometries that can be readily blueprinted.\u00a0Because of the complexity of protein structures and sequence-structure relationships, it has not previously been possible to build up large protein assemblies by deliberate placement of protein backbones onto a blank three-dimensional canvas; the simplicity and geometric regularity of our design platform now enables construction of protein nanomaterials according to 'back of an envelope' architectural blueprints.",

        "abstract":"Three billion years of evolution has produced a tremendous diversity of protein molecules 1 , but the full potential of proteins is likely to be much greater. Accessing this potential has been challenging for both computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to have functions. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences, and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical properties. The crystal structures of two designed proteins exhibit atomistic agreement with Chroma samples (a backbone root-mean-square deviation of around 1.0\u2009\u00c5). With this unified approach to protein design, we hope to accelerate the programming of protein matter to benefit human health, materials science and synthetic biology.",

        "abstract":"Three billion years of evolution has produced a tremendous diversity of protein molecules 1 , but the full potential of proteins is likely to be much greater. Accessing this potential has been challenging for both computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to have functions. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences, and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical properties. The crystal structures of two designed proteins exhibit atomistic agreement with Chroma samples (a backbone root-mean-square deviation of around 1.0\u2009\u00c5). With this unified approach to protein design, we hope to accelerate the programming of protein matter to benefit human health, materials science and synthetic biology.",

        "abstract":"De novo peptide design is a new frontier that has broad application potential in the biological and biomedical fields. Most existing models for de novo peptide design are largely based on sequence homology that can be restricted based on evolutionarily derived protein sequences and lack the physicochemical context essential in protein folding. Generative machine learning for de novo peptide design is a promising way to synthesize theoretical data that are based on, but unique from, the observable universe. In this study, we created and tested a custom peptide generative adversarial network intended to design peptide sequences that can fold into the \u03b2-hairpin secondary structure. This deep neural network model is designed to establish a preliminary foundation of the generative approach based on physicochemical and conformational properties of 20 canonical amino acids, for example, hydrophobicity and residue volume, using extant structure-specific sequence data from the PDB. The beta generative adversarial network model robustly distinguishes secondary structures of \u03b2 hairpin from \u03b1 helix and intrinsically disordered peptides with an accuracy of up to 96% and generates artificial \u03b2-hairpin peptide sequences with minimum sequence identities around 31% and 50% when compared against the current NCBI PDB and nonredundant databases, respectively. These results highlight the potential of generative models specifically anchored by physicochemical and conformational property features of amino acids to expand the sequence-to-structure landscape of proteins beyond evolutionary limits.",

Thus, a general method that improves the physical properties of native proteins while maintaining function could have wide utility for protein-based technologies. Here, we show that the deep neural network ProteinMPNN, together with evolutionary and structural information, provides a route to increasing protein expression, stability, and function. For both myoglobin and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, we generated designs with improved expression, elevated melting temperatures, and improved function. For TEV protease, we identified multiple designs with improved catalytic activity as compared to the parent sequence and previously reported TEV variants. Our approach should be broadly useful for improving the expression, stability, and function of biotechnologically important proteins.",

For the generation of docked conformations, we emphasize a protein fragment-based approach, while for sequence design of the de novo interface, a comparison of knowledge-based and machine learning protocols highlights the power and increased experimental success achieved using ProteinMPNN. An analysis of design outcomes provides insights for improving interface design protocols, including prioritizing fragment-based motifs, balancing interface hydrophobicity and polarity, and identifying preferred polar contact patterns. In all, we report five structures for seven protein cages, along with two structures of intermediate assemblies, with the highest resolution reaching 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 using cryo-EM. This set of designed cages adds substantially to the body of available protein nanoparticles, and to methodologies for their creation.",

        "abstract":"Biomolecules modulate inorganic crystallization to generate hierarchically structured biominerals, but the atomic structure of the organic-inorganic interfaces that regulate mineralization remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that heterogeneous nucleation of calcium carbonate could be achieved by a structured flat molecular template that pre-organizes calcium ions on its surface. To test this hypothesis, we design helical repeat proteins (DHRs) displaying regularly spaced carboxylate arrays on their surfaces and find that both protein monomers and protein-Ca 2+  supramolecular assemblies directly nucleate nano-calcite with non-natural {110} or {202} faces while vaterite, which forms first in the absence of the proteins, is bypassed. These protein-stabilized nanocrystals then assemble by oriented attachment into calcite mesocrystals. We find further that nanocrystal size and polymorph can be tuned by varying the length and surface chemistry of the designed protein templates. Thus, bio-mineralization can be programmed using de novo protein design, providing a route to next-generation hybrid materials.",

        "abstract":"A wooden house frame consists of many different lumber pieces, but because of the regularity of these building blocks, the structure can be designed using straightforward geometrical principles. The design of multicomponent protein assemblies, in comparison, has been much more complex, largely owing to the irregular shapes of protein structures 1 . Here we describe extendable linear, curved and angled protein building blocks, as well as inter-block interactions, that conform to specified geometric standards; assemblies designed using these blocks inherit their extendability and regular interaction surfaces, enabling them to be expanded or contracted by varying the number of modules, and reinforced with secondary struts. Using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, we validate nanomaterial designs ranging from simple polygonal and circular oligomers that can be concentrically nested, up to large polyhedral nanocages and unbounded straight 'train track' assemblies with reconfigurable sizes and geometries that can be readily blueprinted.\u00a0Because of the complexity of protein structures and sequence-structure relationships, it has not previously been possible to build up large protein assemblies by deliberate placement of protein backbones onto a blank three-dimensional canvas; the simplicity and geometric regularity of our design platform now enables construction of protein nanomaterials according to 'back of an envelope' architectural blueprints.",

        "abstract":"A wooden house frame consists of many different lumber pieces, but because of the regularity of these building blocks, the structure can be designed using straightforward geometrical principles. The design of multicomponent protein assemblies, in comparison, has been much more complex, largely owing to the irregular shapes of protein structures 1 . Here we describe extendable linear, curved and angled protein building blocks, as well as inter-block interactions, that conform to specified geometric standards; assemblies designed using these blocks inherit their extendability and regular interaction surfaces, enabling them to be expanded or contracted by varying the number of modules, and reinforced with secondary struts. Using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, we validate nanomaterial designs ranging from simple polygonal and circular oligomers that can be concentrically nested, up to large polyhedral nanocages and unbounded straight 'train track' assemblies with reconfigurable sizes and geometries that can be readily blueprinted.\u00a0Because of the complexity of protein structures and sequence-structure relationships, it has not previously been possible to build up large protein assemblies by deliberate placement of protein backbones onto a blank three-dimensional canvas; the simplicity and geometric regularity of our design platform now enables construction of protein nanomaterials according to 'back of an envelope' architectural blueprints.",

We describe RoseTTAFold All-Atom (RFAA) which combines a residue-based representation of amino acids and DNA bases with an atomic representation of all other groups to model assemblies containing proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, metals, and covalent modifications given their sequences and chemical structures. By fine tuning on denoising tasks we obtain RFdiffusionAA, which builds protein structures around small molecules. Starting from random distributions of amino acid residues surrounding target small molecules, we design and experimentally validate, through crystallography and binding measurements, proteins that bind the cardiac disease therapeutic digoxigenin, the enzymatic cofactor heme, and the light harvesting molecule bilin.",

        "abstract":"The small ultrared fluorescent protein (smURFP) is a bright near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent protein (FP) that forms a dimer and binds its fluorescence chromophore, biliverdin, at its dimer interface. To engineer a monomeric NIR FP based on smURFP potentially more suitable for bioimaging, we employed protein design to extend the protein backbone with a new segment of two helices that shield the original dimer interface while covering the biliverdin binding pocket in place of the second chain in the original dimer. We experimentally characterized 13 designs and obtained a monomeric protein with a weak fluorescence. We enhanced the fluorescence of this designed protein through two rounds of directed evolution and obtained designed monomeric smURFP (DMsmURFP), a bright, stable, and monomeric NIR FP with a molecular weight of 19.6 kDa. We determined the crystal structures of DMsmURFP both in the apo state and in complex with biliverdin, which confirmed the designed structure. The use of DMsmURFP in in vivo imaging of mammalian systems was demonstrated. The backbone design-based strategy used here can also be applied to monomerize other naturally multimeric proteins with intersubunit functional sites.",

        "abstract":"Electrostatic interactions are often critical for determining the specificity of protein-protein complexes. To study the role of electrostatic interactions for assembly of helical bundles, we previously designed a thermostable, heterotrimeric coiled coil, ABC, in which charged residues were employed to drive preferential association of three distinct, 34-residue helices. To investigate the basis for heterotrimer specificity, we have used multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) analysis to determine the 1.8 A resolution crystal structure of ABC. The structure shows that ABC forms a heterotrimeric coiled coil with the intended arrangement of parallel chains. Over half of the ion pairs engineered to restrict helix associations were apparent in the experimental electron density map. As seen in other trimeric coiled coils, ABC displays acute knobs-into-holes packing and a buried anion coordinated by core polar amino acids. These interactions validate the design strategy and illustrate how packing and polar contacts determine structural uniqueness.",

Incorporating metal-binding sites at the target interface may be one approach for increasing affinity and specifying the binding mode, thereby improving robustness of designed interactions for use as tools in basic research as well as in applications from biotechnology to medicine. Here we describe a Rosetta-based approach for the rational design of a protein monomer to form a zinc-mediated, symmetric homodimer. Our metal interface design, named MID1 (NESG target ID OR37), forms a tight dimer in the presence of zinc (MID1-zinc) with a dissociation constant <30 nM. Without zinc the dissociation constant is 4 \u03bcM. The crystal structure of MID1-zinc shows good overall agreement with the computational model, but only three out of four designed histidines coordinate zinc. However, a histidine-to-glutamate point mutation resulted in four-coordination of zinc, and the resulting metal binding site and dimer orientation closely matches the computational model (C\u03b1 rmsd = 1.4 \u00c5).",

        "abstract":"Armadillo repeat proteins (ArmRPs) recognize their target peptide in extended conformation and bind, in a first approximation, two residues per repeat. Thus, they may form the basis for building a modular system, in which each repeat is complementary to a piece of the target peptide. Accordingly, preselected repeats could be assembled into specific binding proteins on demand and thereby avoid the traditional generation of every new binding molecule by an independent selection from a library. Stacked armadillo repeats, each consisting of 42 aa arranged in three \u03b1-helices, build an elongated superhelical structure. Here, we analyzed the curvature variations in natural ArmRPs and identified a repeat pair from yeast importin-\u03b1 as having the optimal curvature geometry that is complementary to a peptide over its whole length. We employed a symmetric in silico design to obtain a uniform sequence for a stackable repeat while maintaining the desired curvature geometry. Computationally designed ArmRPs (dArmRPs) had to be stabilized by mutations to remove regions of higher flexibility, which were identified by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Using an N-capping repeat from the consensus-design approach, two different crystal structures of dArmRP were determined. Although the experimental structures of dArmRP deviated from the designed curvature, the insertion of the most conserved binding pockets of natural ArmRPs onto the surface of dArmRPs resulted in binders against the expected peptide with low nanomolar affinities, similar to the binders from the consensus-design series.",

        "abstract":"A challenge in the computational design of enzymes is that multiple properties, including substrate binding, transition state stabilization and product release, must be simultaneously optimized, and this has limited the absolute activity of successful designs. Here, we focus on a single critical property of many enzymes: the nucleophilicity of an active site residue that initiates catalysis. We design proteins with idealized serine-containing catalytic triads and assess their nucleophilicity directly in native biological systems using activity-based organophosphate probes. Crystal structures of the most successful designs show unprecedented agreement with computational models, including extensive hydrogen bonding networks between the catalytic triad (or quartet) residues, and mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that these networks are critical for serine activation and organophosphate reactivity. Following optimization by yeast display, the designs react with organophosphate probes at rates comparable to natural serine hydrolases. Co-crystal structures with diisopropyl fluorophosphate bound to the serine nucleophile suggest that the designs could provide the basis for a new class of organophosphate capture agents.",

        "abstract":"Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPin \u00ae ) are artificial non-immunoglobulin binding proteins with potential applications as therapeutic molecules. DARPin 6G9 binds interleukin-13 with high affinity and blocks the signaling pathway and as such is promising for the treatment of asthma and other atopic diseases. The crystal structures of DARPin 6G9 in the unbound form and in complex with IL-13 were determined at high resolution. The DARPin competes for the same epitope as the IL-13 receptor chain 13R\u03b11 but does not interfere with the binding of the other receptor chain, IL-4R\u03b1. Analysis of multiple copies of the DARPin molecule in the crystal indicates the conformational instability in the N-terminal cap that was predicted from molecular dynamics simulations. Comparison of the DARPin structures in the free state and in complex with IL-13 reveals a concerted movement of the ankyrin repeats upon binding resulted in the opening of the binding site. The induced-fit mode of binding employed by DARPin 6G9 is very unusual for DARPins since they were designed as particularly stable and rigid molecules. This finding shows that DARPins can operate by various binding mechanisms and suggests that some flexibility in the scaffold may be an advantage.",

        "abstract":"Antimicrobial peptides participate in the first line of defence of many organisms against pathogens. In humans, the family of \u03b2-defensins plays a pivotal role in innate immunity. Two human \u03b2-defensins, \u03b2-defensin-2 and -3 (HBD2 and HBD3), show substantial sequence identity and structural similarity. However, HBD3 kills Staphylococcus (S.) aureus with a 4- to 8-fold higher efficiency compared to HBD2, whereas their activities against Escherichia (E.) coli are very similar. The generation of six HBD2\/HBD3-chimeric molecules led to the identification of distinct molecular regions which mediate their divergent killing properties. One of the chimeras (chimera C3) killed both E. coli and S. aureus with an even higher efficacy compared to the wild-type molecules. Due to the broad spectrum of its antimicrobial activity against many human multidrug-resistant pathogens, this HBD2\/HBD3-chimeric peptide represents a promising candidate for a new class of antibiotics. In order to investigate the structural basis of its exceptional antimicrobial activity, the peptide's tertiary structure was determined by NMR spectroscopy, which allowed its direct comparison to the published structures of HBD2 and HBD3 and the identification of the activity-increasing molecular features.",

A computational method for generating innovative membrane-pore-forming peptides inspired by natural templates is presented. Peptide representation in terms of sequence- and topology-dependent hydrophobic moments is introduced. This design concept proves to be appropriate for the de novo generation of first-in-class membrane-active peptides with the anticipated mode of action. The designed peptides outperform the natural template in terms of their antibacterial activity. They form a kinked helical structure and self-assemble in the membrane by an entropy-driven mechanism to form dynamically growing pores that are dependent on the lipid composition. The results of this study demonstrate the unique potential of natural template-based peptide design for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.",

        "abstract":"Adenoviruses (Ads) have shown promise as vectors for gene delivery in clinical trials. Efficient viral targeting to a tissue of choice requires both ablation of the virus' original tropism and engineering of an efficient receptor-mediated uptake by a specific cell population. We have developed a series of adapters binding to the virus with such high affinity that they remain fully bound for >10 d, block its natural receptor binding site and mediate interaction with a surface receptor of choice. The adapter contains two fused modules, both consisting of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), one binding to the fiber knob of adenovirus serotype 5 and the other binding to various tumor markers. By solving the crystal structure of the complex of the trimeric knob with three bound DARPins at 1.95-\u00c5 resolution, we could use computer modeling to design a link to a trimeric protein of extraordinary kinetic stability, the capsid protein SHP from the lambdoid phage 21. We arrived at a module which binds the knob like a trimeric clamp. When this clamp was fused with DARPins of varying specificities, it enabled adenovirus serotype 5-mediated delivery of a transgene in a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-, epidermal growth factor receptor-, or epithelial cell adhesion molecule-dependent manner with transduction efficiencies comparable to or even exceeding those of Ad itself. With these adapters, efficiently produced in Escherichia coli, Ad can be converted rapidly to new receptor specificities using any ligand as the receptor-binding moiety. Prefabricated Ads with different payloads thus can be retargeted readily to many cell types of choice.",

        "abstract":"We previously designed a new family of artificial proteins named \u03b1Rep based on a subgroup of thermostable helicoidal HEAT-like repeats. We have now assembled a large optimized \u03b1Rep library. In this library, the side chains at each variable position are not fully randomized but instead encoded by a distribution of codons based on the natural frequency of side chains of the natural repeats family. The library construction is based on a polymerization of micro-genes and therefore results in a distribution of proteins with a variable number of repeats. We improved the library construction process using a \"filtration\" procedure to retain only fully coding modules that were recombined to recreate sequence diversity. The final library named Lib2.1 contains 1.7\u00d710(9) independent clones. Here, we used phage display to select, from the previously described library or from the new library, new specific \u03b1Rep proteins binding to four different non-related predefined protein targets. Specific binders were selected in each case. The results show that binders with various sizes are selected including relatively long sequences, with up to 7 repeats. ITC-measured affinities vary with Kd values ranging from micromolar to nanomolar ranges. The formation of complexes is associated with a significant thermal stabilization of the bound target protein. The crystal structures of two complexes between \u03b1Rep and their cognate targets were solved and show that the new interfaces are established by the variable surfaces of the repeated modules, as well by the variable N-cap residues. These results suggest that \u03b1Rep library is a new and versatile source of tight and specific binding proteins with favorable biophysical properties.",

        "abstract":"Generating artificial protein assemblies with complex shapes requires a method for connecting protein components with stable and predictable structures. Currently available methods for creating rigid protein assemblies rely on either complicated calculations or extensive trial and error. We describe a simple and efficient method for connecting two proteins via a fused alpha helix that is formed by joining two preexisting helices into a single extended helix. Because the end-to-end ligation of helices does not guarantee the formation of a continuous helix, we superimposed 1-2 turns of pairs of connecting helices by using a molecular graphics program. Then, we chose amino acids from the two natural sequences that would stabilize the connecting helix. This \"shared helix method\" is highly efficient. All the designed proteins that could be produced in Escherichia coli were readily crystallized and had the expected fusion structures. To prove the usefulness of this method, we produced two novel repeat proteins by assembling several copies of natural or artificial proteins with alpha helices at both termini. Their crystal structures demonstrated the successful assembly of the repeating units with the intended curved shapes. We propose that this method could dramatically expand the available repertoire of natural repeat proteins.",

VG13P displays an enhanced anti-endotoxin property as evident from significant reduction in LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 gene expression levels in a monocytic cell line, while it retains almost unchanged antimicrobial activity as its parent VG16KRKP against Gram-negative bacterial as well as fungal pathogens. In addition, in vitro LPS binding properties of VG13P in comparison to its parent VG16KRKP also remained unhindered, suggesting that the flexible C-terminal end of VG16KRKP may not play a major role in its observed antibacterial and LPS binding properties. An NMR-resolved solution structure of VG13P in LPS reveals two consecutive \u03b2-turns: one at the N-terminus, followed by another at the central region, closely resembling a rocking chair. The crucial Lys6Gly mutation along with C-terminal truncation from VG16KRKP reorients the hydrophobic hub in VG13P in a unique way so as to fold the N-terminal end back on itself, forming a turn and allowing Val1 and Ala2 to interact with Leu11 and Phe12 to bring the hydrophobic residues closer together to form a more compact hub compared to its parent. The hub is further strengthened via CH-\u03c0 interaction between Gly4 and Phe12. This accounts for its improved anti-endotoxin activity as well as to its uninterrupted antimicrobial activity.",

        "abstract":"Chemical and optogenetic methods for post-translationally controlling protein function have enabled modulation and engineering of cellular functions. However, most of these methods only confer single-input, single-output control. To increase the diversity of post-translational behaviors that can be programmed, we built a system based on a single protein receiver that can integrate multiple drug inputs, including approved therapeutics. Our system translates drug inputs into diverse outputs using a suite of engineered reader proteins to provide variable dimerization states of the receiver protein. We show that our single receiver protein architecture can be used to program a variety of cellular responses, including graded and proportional dual-output control of transcription and mammalian cell signaling. We apply our tools to titrate the competing activities of the Rac and Rho GTPases to control cell morphology. Our versatile tool set will enable researchers to post-translationally program mammalian cellular processes and to engineer cell therapies.",

        "abstract":"Computationally designing protein-protein interactions with high affinity and desired orientation is a challenging task. Incorporating metal-binding sites at the target interface may be one approach for increasing affinity and specifying the binding mode, thereby improving robustness of designed interactions for use as tools in basic research as well as in applications from biotechnology to medicine. Here we describe a Rosetta-based approach for the rational design of a protein monomer to form a zinc-mediated, symmetric homodimer. Our metal interface design, named MID1 (NESG target ID OR37), forms a tight dimer in the presence of zinc (MID1-zinc) with a dissociation constant <30 nM. Without zinc the dissociation constant is 4 \u03bcM. The crystal structure of MID1-zinc shows good overall agreement with the computational model, but only three out of four designed histidines coordinate zinc. However, a histidine-to-glutamate point mutation resulted in four-coordination of zinc, and the resulting metal binding site and dimer orientation closely matches the computational model (C\u03b1 rmsd = 1.4 \u00c5).",

        "abstract":"We previously designed a new family of artificial proteins named \u03b1Rep based on a subgroup of thermostable helicoidal HEAT-like repeats. We have now assembled a large optimized \u03b1Rep library. In this library, the side chains at each variable position are not fully randomized but instead encoded by a distribution of codons based on the natural frequency of side chains of the natural repeats family. The library construction is based on a polymerization of micro-genes and therefore results in a distribution of proteins with a variable number of repeats. We improved the library construction process using a \"filtration\" procedure to retain only fully coding modules that were recombined to recreate sequence diversity. The final library named Lib2.1 contains 1.7\u00d710(9) independent clones. Here, we used phage display to select, from the previously described library or from the new library, new specific \u03b1Rep proteins binding to four different non-related predefined protein targets. Specific binders were selected in each case. The results show that binders with various sizes are selected including relatively long sequences, with up to 7 repeats. ITC-measured affinities vary with Kd values ranging from micromolar to nanomolar ranges. The formation of complexes is associated with a significant thermal stabilization of the bound target protein. The crystal structures of two complexes between \u03b1Rep and their cognate targets were solved and show that the new interfaces are established by the variable surfaces of the repeated modules, as well by the variable N-cap residues. These results suggest that \u03b1Rep library is a new and versatile source of tight and specific binding proteins with favorable biophysical properties.",
